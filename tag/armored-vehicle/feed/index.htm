<p><strong>Armored vehicles</strong> have become essential tools for personal and corporate security. They offer increased protection in potentially volatile situations while maintaining convenience and comfort. In the United States, <strong>regulations</strong> surrounding armored vehicles vary by state, making it crucial to understand the <strong>local requirements</strong> before purchasing or operating one. Whether you’re searching for an <strong>armored SUV</strong> for secure family travel or an armored sedan for professional use, knowing these rules will help you make an informed choice.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Understanding the Regulatory Landscape</strong></h2>



<p>Each state has its own laws governing the <strong>ownership and operation</strong> of armored vehicles. These regulations can encompass everything from the process of registering the vehicle to the specifics of window tinting. Typically, owners must comply with <strong>federal safety standards</strong> that apply to all motor vehicles, along with additional, localized criteria—such as proof of purpose for the armored vehicle.</p>



<p>Before acquiring an <strong>armored SUV</strong>, consult your state&#8217;s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) or an experienced legal advisor to clarify any special permits, labels, or documentation you might need. Doing your homework ahead of time helps you avoid unpleasant surprises and allows you to focus on the <strong>benefits</strong> that an armored vehicle can provide.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Differences from State to State</strong></h2>



<p>With so many different rules, the <strong>variations</strong> between states can be significant. For instance, some states may require specialized licensing for drivers who operate heavily armored vehicles, while others may have stringent requirements for ballistic-resistant glass. In regions with higher traffic congestion, additional guidelines might exist regarding maximum vehicle dimensions or weight limits.</p>



<p>Because regulations differ substantially across the country, <strong>vehicle owners</strong> sometimes find themselves adapting to new requirements if they travel frequently between states. If you plan to move or use your armored vehicle across various regions, it pays to prepare by reviewing the relevant laws or contacting local authorities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Certifications and Testing Requirements</strong></h2>



<p>To maintain the <strong>highest safety standards</strong>, manufacturers like <a href="https://troyarmoring.com/suvs/">Troy Armoring</a> rigorously test their vehicles to ensure they meet or exceed recognized industry benchmarks. These tests typically include <strong>ballistic standards</strong> (such as those outlined by the National Institute of Justice) and structural integrity evaluations. Many states and federal agencies look favorably upon vehicles that carry certifications from well-known testing organizations.</p>



<p>Whether you’re interested in an <strong>armored SUV</strong> or sedan from <a href="https://troyarmoring.com/sedans/">Troy Armoring</a>, you’ll benefit from this <strong>comprehensive testing</strong>. It serves as a seal of quality that can support any paperwork or inspections required by local authorities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Choosing the Right Armored SUV</strong></h2>



<p>An <strong>armored SUV</strong> is popular for those seeking comfort and robust security on the road. Adding interior space can accommodate family members, staff, or equipment while offering <strong>superior protection</strong>. However, selecting the right model involves more than just comparing prices. Consider the vehicle’s <strong>armor level</strong>, which relates to its protective capabilities, along with any specific local regulations on modifications—like ballistic glass thickness or run-flat tires—that might affect its eligibility for registration in your state.</p>



<p>Consulting with an experienced manufacturer or dealer, such as Troy Armoring, gives you access to professional advice on how best to navigate these <strong>regulatory hurdles</strong>. They can also support maintenance, repairs, and ongoing compliance with evolving state laws.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> </p>



<p>Navigating the local <strong>regulations and requirements</strong> for armored vehicles in the United States may seem daunting. However, with some research, expert guidance, and a reliable manufacturer, you can acquire a car that offers security, comfort, and peace of mind. From robust <strong>armored SUVs</strong> that carry your loved ones to specialized sedans crafted for executive travel, there&#8217;s no shortage of options for those looking to enhance their safety on the road. By staying informed and consulting the right professionals, you&#8217;ll be well on your way to confidently owning and operating your own <strong>armored vehicle</strong>.</p>

<p>Diplomacy is a delicate and critical aspect of international relations, often operating under the radar yet fundamental in shaping global politics. An integral yet often overlooked element in these missions is the use of <strong>Armored Vehicles</strong>. These vehicles serve not only as a mode of transportation but also as a shield, a statement, and a tool for negotiation in the complex world of diplomacy.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ensuring Safety in Unstable Regions</strong></h2>



<p>The foremost role of <strong>Armored Vehicles</strong> in diplomatic missions is to provide unmatched safety. Diplomats often travel to volatile regions where the risk of armed conflict, kidnapping, and terrorist attacks is high. In such scenarios, armored sedans and SUVs serve as a mobile fortress, offering protection from potential attacks. The security offered by these vehicles is paramount, allowing diplomats to focus on their mission without the constant fear for their personal safety.</p>



<p>For a closer look at how armored vehicles blend safety with luxury, our collection of <a href="https://troyarmoring.com/armored-sedans-redefining-road-safety-and-luxury/">Armored Sedans</a> showcases the balance of comfort and security.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A Symbol of Commitment and Respect</strong></h2>



<p>Armored Vehicles in diplomatic missions also symbolize a nation&#8217;s commitment to and respect for the safety of its representatives and those they meet. The use of a high-quality armored vehicle demonstrates a country&#8217;s investment in the well-being of its diplomatic corps, underscoring the importance it places on international relations and the safety of its personnel.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Facilitating Confidential Conversations</strong></h2>



<p>The private and secure environment of an <strong>Armored Vehicle</strong> is ideal for confidential conversations and negotiations that often accompany diplomatic missions. These vehicles are equipped with state-of-the-art communication systems and soundproofing, creating a mobile office environment where sensitive discussions can take place away from potential eavesdroppers.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Navigating Through Challenging Terrains</strong></h3>



<p>Diplomats are often required to travel through challenging terrains and environments. Armored SUVs, such as those in our <a href="https://troyarmoring.com/suvs/">Armored SUVs collection</a>, are specifically designed to handle difficult roads while providing the highest level of security. This capability ensures that diplomats can reach remote locations safely, a crucial aspect of diplomatic missions in less accessible areas.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Evolving with Technological Advancements</strong></h3>



<p>As threats evolve, so do the requirements for diplomatic vehicles. Modern <strong>Armored Vehicles</strong> are equipped with the latest in security technology, including advanced surveillance systems, night-vision capabilities, and GPS tracking. This constant evolution in technology ensures that diplomats have the best resources at their disposal to navigate the increasingly complex landscape of international relations.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> </p>



<p>The role of <strong>Armored Vehicles</strong> in diplomatic missions is multifaceted and invaluable. They are not merely tools for safe transportation but are critical assets that facilitate the smooth execution of diplomatic activities. These vehicles provide a secure, private, and sophisticated environment necessary for the delicate tasks of diplomacy. In a world where geopolitical landscapes are constantly shifting, the stability and security offered by armored vehicles remain a constant, unsung hero in the realm of international diplomacy.</p>

<p>Owning an <strong>armored SUV</strong> is a significant investment in safety and luxury. However, to ensure that your vehicle remains reliable and functional, regular maintenance is key. Here are six essential maintenance tips to keep your armored SUV running smoothly.</p>



<p><strong>1. Regular Engine Checks</strong></p>



<p>The engine is the heart of your armored SUV, and it works harder than in standard vehicles due to the added weight of armor. Regular engine checks are crucial. This includes monitoring oil levels, checking for leaks, and ensuring that the cooling system is functioning properly to prevent overheating. Regular oil changes and filter replacements are also essential to maintain engine health.</p>



<p>Explore the range of our durable and high-performance <a href="https://troyarmoring.com/suvs/">armored SUVs here</a>.</p>



<p><strong>2. Tire Maintenance is Critical</strong></p>



<p>Armored vehicles have specially designed tires to handle extra weight and, in some cases, continue running even when punctured. Regularly inspect tires for wear and tear, maintain correct tire pressure, and have a schedule for tire rotation. This will not only extend the life of the tires but also ensure your SUV handles as expected in critical situations.</p>



<p><strong>3. Suspension and Brake Systems</strong></p>



<p>The suspension and brake systems of an <strong>armored SUV</strong> undergo more stress due to the vehicle&#8217;s increased weight. Regular inspections are necessary to ensure that shock absorbers, struts, and brake pads are in optimal condition. Replacing worn parts promptly is essential to maintain the performance and safety of the vehicle.</p>



<p><strong>4. Checking Electrical Systems</strong></p>



<p>The electrical system in an armored SUV powers critical security features. Regular checks of the battery, alternator, and wiring help prevent failures. Pay special attention to any unusual electrical behavior, as this can be a sign of deeper issues.</p>



<p><strong>5. Armor Integrity Inspections</strong></p>



<p>The armor of your SUV is what provides the high level of protection. Regular inspections for any damage or wear are essential. Look for signs of rust or corrosion, particularly in hidden areas, and ensure that all armored panels and glass are secure and intact.</p>



<p>For more insights on what makes an ideal armored SUV, check out <a href="https://troyarmoring.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-choosing-your-perfect-armored-suv/">our detailed guide</a>.</p>



<p><strong>6. Professional Servicing and Repairs</strong></p>



<p>Finally, due to the specialized nature of armored SUVs, it&#8217;s crucial to have your vehicle serviced by professionals experienced in armored vehicles. They understand the unique aspects of these vehicles and can provide the best care and advice. Regular professional servicing will ensure that all aspects of your SUV, from its armor to its engine, are in top condition.</p>



<p>Maintaining an <strong>armored SUV</strong> requires a bit more attention than a standard vehicle, but the effort is well worth it. By following these maintenance tips, you ensure that your armored SUV remains a reliable protector and a comfortable ride. Remember, the key to longevity in armored vehicles lies in regular, meticulous care.

<p>When you think of <strong>armored vehicles</strong>, it&#8217;s hard not to picture James Bond maneuvering through dangerous terrains and evading bullets effortlessly. But armored cars have a rich history beyond the big screen. They&#8217;ve evolved from cumbersome military tanks to sleek, everyday vehicles you can park in your garage.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a><strong>The Birth of a Legend: World War I and II</strong></h2>



<p>Armored vehicles were born out of necessity during the First and Second World Wars. Back then, they were primarily used as tanks and armored personnel carriers. These lumbering giants were pivotal in both wars, offering protection to soldiers and allowing them to cross hostile environments. While the design was far from subtle, it set the foundation for what would come. You can learn more about the military roots of armored vehicles in this comprehensive<a href="https://troyarmoring.com/the-evolution-of-armored-vehicles-a-journey-from-wwii-tanks-to-modern-day-armored-cars/"> </a><a href="https://troyarmoring.com/the-evolution-of-armored-vehicles-a-journey-from-wwii-tanks-to-modern-day-armored-cars/">guide</a>.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a><strong>The Secret Agent Era: The 1960s and Onwards</strong></h2>



<p>During the 1960s, the perception of armored vehicles began to change. These vehicles became sleeker and more glamorous thanks to the cinema, namely James Bond films. The 1964 film Goldfinger featured an Aston Martin DB5 equipped with <strong>bulletproof windows</strong>, revolving license plates, and other spy-worthy gadgets. This film created a mystique around armored vehicles, painting them as the ultimate combination of luxury and security.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a><strong>Civilian Use and Evolution: The 90s to the Present Day</strong></h2>



<p>As technology progressed, the adaptation of armored cars trickled down to civilian use. By the 1990s, the production of these vehicles expanded dramatically. They became popular among politicians, celebrities, and high-ranking executives who sought an extra layer of protection.</p>



<p>At<a href="https://troyarmoring.com/"> </a><a href="https://troyarmoring.com/">Troy Armoring</a>, we pride ourselves on being at the forefront of this evolution. Our vehicles are designed with cutting-edge technology, ensuring that they not only offer protection but also exude luxury and style.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a><strong>Advancements in Technology and Materials</strong></h3>



<p>The leap from military tanks to modern-day armored vehicles was made possible by the advancements in materials and technology. Light-weight, high-strength materials such as ballistic steel and bulletproof glass have allowed adding armor without significantly altering a car&#8217;s appearance or handling. Today&#8217;s armored cars can withstand bullets, blasts, and even chemical attacks while maintaining a stylish facade.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a><strong>The Customization Revolution</strong></h3>



<p>The modern era of armored vehicles is also marked by the ability to customize according to individual needs. <strong>Troy Armoring</strong> offers a wide range of<a href="https://troyarmoring.com/personal-and-corporate-solutions/"> </a><a href="https://troyarmoring.com/vip-and-executive-package/">customization options</a>, from varying levels of ballistic protection to luxury interiors, ensuring that your vehicle is tailored to your unique preferences.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a><strong>From Battlefields to Boulevards</strong></h2>



<p>In conclusion, armored vehicles have come a long way from their clunky military ancestors. Today, they embody the <strong>perfect blend of luxury, style, and security</strong>. Whether you’re a government official or a private citizen seeking additional safety, Troy Armoring has a vehicle designed to meet your needs. It’s not just about having a fortified shell; it’s about riding in style with peace of mind.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a><strong>What the Future Holds</strong></h2>

<p>Armored sedans provide a great deal of protection, along with a luxury experience. After all, most armored sedans began as luxury or well-equipped sedans. From there, armored plates and other security features were added to keep the passengers and cargo secure. But who is a good candidate for an armored sedan?</p>



<p><strong>Political Leaders</strong></p>



<p>One of the most common uses for <a href="https://troyarmoring.com/sedans/"><strong>armored sedans</strong></a> is for political leaders. Presidents and prime ministers use armored sedans, but they aren’t only for political leaders on the national level. State leaders, mayors, and political leaders of smaller geographic areas can benefit from an armored sedan. After all, politicians can’t please everyone, and they need protection from disgruntled citizens.</p>



<p><strong>Business Leaders</strong></p>



<p>Business leaders, especially C-suite executives of major companies, are also good candidates for armored sedans. Some people may have bad intentions because of their fame or wealth. There is also the risk that someone will be unhappy with the actions of the company and choose to blame the C-suite executives. An armored sedan will protect business leaders in any of these situations.</p>



<p><strong>Celebrities</strong></p>



<p>Anyone with a high profile will attract a great deal of attention wherever they go. From direct threats against their safety to someone looking to break into the car and steal something, celebrities on all levels face various potential threats. But an armored car can mitigate most of these.</p>



<p><strong>High-net-worth Individuals</strong></p>



<p>High-net-worth individuals should also consider an armored sedan. People may try to kidnap them for ransom, steal from them, or hurt them in hopes of getting their wealth. The extra protection of an armored sedan gives high-net-worth individuals more peace of mind.</p>



<p><strong>People Transporting Valuables</strong></p>



<p>Armored sedans are also a good option for anyone transporting valuable items. Whether art, jewelry, money, or something else, transporting valuables in an armored vehicle reduces the risk of theft. After all, would-be thieves can’t break into the car or easily damage it in a collision with the goal of getting inside after.</p>



<p><strong>Anyone Looking for More Security</strong></p>



<p>While anyone in the above categories is a good candidate for an armored sedan, the reality is that they are also a good option for <a href="https://troyarmoring.com/why-an-armored-sedan-might-be-right-for-you/">anyone who wants additional security</a>. Armored vehicles are a good way to stay safe while maintaining a low profile. An armored sedan will not draw as much attention as other vehicles, such as an armored limo or SUV. Yet, you still get a high level of protection.</p>



<p>Given that most people who would want an armored vehicle are used to the finer things in life, you will find many armored versions of luxury sedans. But if you want to minimize attention, you can even opt for an armored Camry.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> </p>



<p>Armored sedans are incredibly popular among political leaders, business owners, C-suite executives, celebrities, and wealthy individuals. They are also commonly useful in transporting valuables. Nonetheless, anyone who wants to feel more secure should consider an armored sedan, even if it is because you live in a dangerous area.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In many ways, maintaining an <a href="https://troyarmoring.com/suvs/"><strong>armored SUV</strong></a> is very similar to maintaining any other vehicle. You need to change the car’s tires, wash it regularly, and inspect the various belts, hoses, and other components according to the owner’s manual. But some aspects of automotive maintenance are more important for armored vehicles than others.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Always Inspect the Tires and Wheels</strong></h2>



<p>While the <a href="https://troyarmoring.com/is-it-possible-to-patch-a-run-flat-tire/">tires</a> and wheels are important on any vehicle, this is especially true of armored vehicles. An issue with wheel alignment or a punctured or deflated tire can make your vehicle an easy target. Underinflated tires can also worsen handling, making it harder to control the armored vehicle. So, get in the habit of inspecting the tires regularly. If you are using an armored vehicle for a high-profile person, there is no such thing as inspecting the tires too frequently.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Keep an Eye on the Chassis</strong></h2>



<p>The chassis is one component of an armored SUV that will need more attention than a non-armored one. This comes from the additional weight of all the armored plates added to the vehicle. SUVs are carefully chosen before adding the plates to ensure they can handle the extra weight. Even so, you will need to inspect the chassis of an armored SUV more frequently than you would on a regular SUV.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Test the Brakes Regularly</strong></h3>



<p>Any vehicle should have its brakes checked regularly, whether or not it is armored. After all, brakes are one of the most important components for staying safe on the road, as they let you stop and avoid collisions.</p>



<p>But brakes on armored vehicles are a special consideration for a few reasons. To start, the security concerns that make you opt for an armored vehicle mean you want your SUV to be highly maneuverable. This way, you can count on its handling and braking to get you out of sticky situations.</p>



<p>Additionally, the brakes of armored vehicles are under additional pressure because of the added weight. As such, they could experience more wear than you would with a regular SUV.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Install and Maintain a GPS Tracker</strong></h3>



<p>While not necessarily maintenance, every armored SUV should have a GPS tracker. The people or items inside these SUVs are important enough to require extra protection. As such, it stands to reason that you also want to be able to find them at all times. A GPS tracker can prevent a would-be kidnapper or thief from being successful.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bonus: Ask Your Armored SUV Vendor for Any Special Instructions</strong></h4>



<p>The absolute best way to maintain your armored SUV is to <a href="https://troyarmoring.com/faq-everything-you-need-to-know-about-armored-cars/">ask</a> the manufacturer or vendor for special instructions. They will give you these instructions automatically when you buy the vehicle, but you can always ask for more information. Since their engineers handled the armored SUV’s conversion, they are the best equipped to know what maintenance it needs.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> </p>



<p>To maintain an armored SUV, you must follow all of the basic maintenance that you would for any other vehicle. But pay special attention to the tires, chassis, and brakes. When in doubt, ask the armored SUV manufacturer or vendor for any special maintenance required.</p>

<p>If you already have an armored SUV but aren’t using it all the time, consider turning it into a side hustle. You can easily rent it out when you aren’t using it. This will let you take advantage of the demand for rental armored SUVs and maximize your vehicle’s abilities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>There Is High Demand</strong></h2>



<p>Whether or not you realize it, there is a high demand for rental <a href="https://troyarmoring.com/suvs/"><strong>armored SUVs</strong></a>. Many people are accustomed to using armored vehicles at home but don’t necessarily own one in every city. Driving the armored vehicle or having someone else do so is likely feasible for closer destinations. But if someone with an armored SUV travels more than a few hours, then they will likely want to rent one at their destination. This will be easier logistically and reduce the wear on their armored vehicle.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Rent to Rich, Influential, and Famous People</em></h3>



<p>The biggest customer base interested in renting your armored SUV would be those who are rich, influential, powerful, or famous. These people are likely to usually drive around in armored vehicles as a way to stay safe from physical harm, kidnapping, and theft. They will want this same level of security and safety when in your city as they experience at home.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Rent to Civilians in Dangerous Areas</em></h3>



<p>Depending on where you live, you can also find an even wider range of people potentially interested in renting your SUV. This is especially true if you live close to or in a <a href="https://troyarmoring.com/5-most-dangerous-cities-in-canada/">dangerous</a> area, as travelers may want extra protection from an armored vehicle.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Rent It Out Based on Your Schedule</strong></h3>



<p>The great thing about renting out your armored SUV as a side hustle is that you can control the schedule. You can rent it out as much or as little as you want. You can even adapt how frequently you rent it out throughout the year.</p>



<p>For example, perhaps you are usually in town and use your armored SUV nearly every day. You could rent it out for a few hours or days here and there when you know you won’t need it. But then, when you go on vacation to another country and won’t use the armored SUV, you could rent it for weeks or even months. The rental schedule is entirely up to you.</p>



<p>You can even buy an armored SUV just to rent out and only occasionally use it yourself.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Choose a Luxurious Armored SUV to Expand Its Appeal</strong></h2>



<p>If you plan on renting your armored SUV and haven’t bought one yet, consider getting a more luxurious version. This will increase its appeal to renters and upgrade your experience every time you ride in or drive it.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> </p>



<p>Most people with armored SUVs don’t need to use them 24/7. Whether there are regular times every week when you don’t use the vehicle, or you are out of town for weeks at a time, consider renting it out when you don’t need it.</p>

<p>Unexpected things can happen while you’re on the road. There&#8217;s the possibility of getting into an accident or experiencing minor inconveniences like&nbsp;getting a flat tire. When the latter happens, you have no choice but to stop on the side of the road and try to fix it. However, if you&#8217;re in the middle of nowhere and need tools, that&#8217;s not always an option.</p>



<p>The good news is that most vehicles now run on <a href="https://troyarmoring.com/how-run-flat-tires-can-benefit-your-armored-car/">RFTs or run-flat tires</a>. If you have these tires, you can continue to drive even after a puncture.</p>



<p>However, remember that you can&#8217;t drive on run-flat tires indefinitely. These tires are designed to let you drive until you find an auto shop or a place to repair them.</p>



<p><strong>Time to Fix Those Tires</strong></p>



<p>Can your run-flat tire be patched or repaired? The good news is that, yes, RFTs can be fixed. Here&#8217;s a step-by-step guide on how to do that:</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" type="1" start="1">
<li>Remove the affected tire from the wheels.</li>



<li>Next, make sure to clean the punctured area on the tire. You can rub mild abrasives on the affected area to make the task easier.</li>



<li>If you&#8217;re DIY-ing this, you can use a plaster patch to cover the hole. At repair shops, they usually cover the puncture using solid rubber studs.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Repeat the steps if there is more than one puncture.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>



<p>Most run-flat tires can be repaired depending on the tire&#8217;s condition and the manufacturer&#8217;s policy. You should be aware that the tires will only be repaired after a thorough interior and exterior examination.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you know, run-flat tires have extended mobility up to 50 miles per hour when punctured. However, even when you follow these limitations, there is still a chance that the tires will be permanently damaged and cannot be repaired.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, you also can’t patch RFTs if the holes are more extensive. In such cases, you will need to replace the tires entirely.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>FAQs on Patching RFTs</strong></p>



<p><em>Is it safe to use a patched tire?</em></p>



<p>When repaired correctly, a patched tire will work just as well as a properly maintained one. This tire will still be able to give you a safe driving experience.</p>



<p><em>Can leaking RFTs be fixed?</em></p>



<p>Yes, these can be fixed. However, that will depend on how extensive the damage is. For puncture holes and small leaks, patching will be the most economical choice. Otherwise, you will need to get a new tire.</p>



<p><em>Can a run-flat tire with a nail be repaired?</em></p>



<p>In most cases, you can remove the pin using tools you have at home. But, if you have yet to experience fixing a punctured tire, it will be better to take it to an auto repair shop.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Run Flat Tires for Armored Vehicle</strong></p>



<p>Just like running flat tires on non-armored vehicles, there will be a time when you need a replacement RFT for your <a href="https://troyarmoring.com/sedans/">armored sedan</a> or SUV. When that happens, you can always contact Troy Armoring. We have spare parts and OEM vehicle parts for armored sedans and SUVs. Make sure to enter your VIN if your vehicle is from us so we can efficiently send what you need.

<p>Back in the day, chainmail and steel plates protected riders and their horses from enemy attacks. But this was when the primary mode of transportation was on horseback, and the only threats were swords and arrows.</p>



<p>Now, we have advanced to using cars, and the threats have evolved to include bullets and explosions. With the artillery available to potentially hostile forces, it&#8217;s crucial to ensure your car is appropriately armored to protect you and your passengers. How do you know if your vehicle has the proper protection? The answer lies in understanding armor levels.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Armor Level Ratings</h3>



<p>Armor levels or&nbsp;<a href="https://troyarmoring.com/ballistic-protection-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ballistic protection levels</a>&nbsp;are ratings assigned to protective materials based on their ability to withstand attacks from certain weapons. These ratings are represented by the&nbsp;<a href="https://nij.ojp.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Institute of Justice</a>&nbsp;(NIJ) standard, a set of guidelines created in 1972 to ensure uniformity and consistency in the protection offered by body armor.</p>



<p>Each level corresponds to the type of ammunition it can resist. For example, B4 armor can protect against .357 Magnum and 9mm handguns and shotguns. B6 armor, on the other hand, can withstand attacks from high-power rifle rounds. The higher the level, the more protection offered.</p>



<p><strong>How to Choose the Right Armor Level Rating for Your Vehicle</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Assess Your Potential Threats&nbsp;</h3>



<p>What hostile forces are you most likely to encounter? Are they armed with handguns or high-powered rifles?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Different vehicle users&nbsp;may face various unique threats. For example, government officials and VIPs may need to protect against high-powered weapons. Meanwhile, a business executive in a low-crime area may only need to protect against handguns.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. The Vehicle You Drive</h3>



<p>Do you want to navigate the streets more efficiently with a&nbsp;<a href="https://troyarmoring.com/sedans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sedan</a>, or do you need an&nbsp;<a href="https://troyarmoring.com/suvs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SUV</a>&nbsp;for added protection and to accommodate more passengers?&nbsp;</p>



<p>While advancements in technology have resulted in lighter and more durable armor materials, make sure to also consider the weight of the added protection. Higher armor levels may require a larger and sturdier vehicle to support it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Your Budget</h3>



<p>Should you splurge on the highest level of protection available, or is a lower level sufficient for your needs?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, armor-level ratings also come with varying price points. It&#8217;s essential to find a balance between the level of protection you need and what you can afford.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Features and Add-ons</h3>



<p>Are there any additional features you may want to add?</p>



<p>Beyond armor levels, you can consider other features and add-ons for added security.&nbsp;<a href="https://troyarmoring.com/how-bulletproof-glass-works/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bulletproof glass</a>, run-flat tires, and an emergency evacuation system are just some options to further protect you in the event of an attack.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Takeaway</h3>



<p>Your safety and that of your passengers should always be a priority. Remember to assess your potential threats, choose a vehicle that can support added protection, consider your budget, and look into additional features and add-ons. With the right armor level, you can navigate the roads confidently, knowing that there is enough protection for you and your loved ones. If you&#8217;re unsure where to start,&nbsp;<a href="https://troyarmoring.com/contact-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">talk to a Troy Armoring specialist</a>&nbsp;who can guide you in choosing the right level of protection for your vehicle.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>When most people think of an armored vehicle, they imagine the type of protection a world leader needs. Or maybe you think of the armored vehicles used when transporting cash or valuables.</p>



<p>While those are certainly potential uses for armored vehicles, they are far from these vehicles’ only purposes. Nearly anyone can benefit from an armored vehicle. Take a look at some people who may want to consider one of these autos with some extra protection.</p>



<h2 class="gb-headline gb-headline-2fa11292 gb-headline-text"><strong>The Rich, Famous, and Powerful</strong></h2>



<p>Perhaps the largest category of people who could benefit from an armored vehicle includes rich, famous, and powerful people. This includes everyone from A-list celebrities to world leaders to CEOs.</p>



<p>It is a simple fact that if you are rich or powerful, or even famous, then there is probably at least one person in the world who has ill wishes for your future. An armored car will protect you from those people if they choose to act on it.</p>



<p>Of course, not everyone in this category should consider an armored vehicle equally strongly. For example, political leaders almost always need an armored vehicle, thanks to the risk of threats to their life. With the <a href="https://troyarmoring.com/vip-and-executive-package/">rich</a> and famous, the concern may lean more towards robbery, kidnapping, or simply gaining access. An armored vehicle can provide plenty of protection in such situations.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Military and Law Enforcement</strong></h3>



<p>Armored vehicles are a given in a military setting, but some police departments are also starting to consider these vehicles. They add another level of protection for your team, whether they are police or military. This, in turn, lets them focus on their job of protecting and serving the community.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Those Transporting Valuables</strong></h3>



<p><a href="https://troyarmoring.com/cash-in-transit/">Cash-in-transit</a> vehicles are yet another very common type of armored vehicle. Because of the amount of cash or other valuables that these autos carry, they are at a high risk of being a target of theft.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Those in Dangerous Areas</strong></h3>



<p>Even if you aren’t famous or transporting large amounts of valuables, it can still be very helpful to have an armored auto if you live in a dangerous area. What constitutes danger will depend on you, but if there is a risk of gunshots or even just auto break-ins in your area, it may be worth it to consider an armored car.
