<p>Owning and operating an armored car has many perks. You can transport valuable goods and feel secure knowing your cargo is protected. But there are also important considerations to keep in mind and many factors to consider before investing. So, to help you make an informed decision, here are the answers to some frequently asked questions about armored cars.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Do I need an armored car?</strong></h3>



<p>This ultimately depends on your specific circumstances and needs. If you regularly transport high-value items or are at risk for theft or attack, an armored car may be a necessary investment for security and peace of mind. Even if these risks are not constantly present in your&nbsp;<a href="https://troyarmoring.com/list-of-businesses-that-use-armored-vehicles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">line of work,</a>&nbsp;armored cars can still be a wise investment for emergencies or unexpected situations.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What are the different levels of armoring?</strong></h3>



<p>The amount and type of <a href="https://troyarmoring.com/ballistic-protection-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ballistic protection</a>&nbsp;determine the armoring levels. Level B4 offers essential protection from handguns, while Level B7 offers protection from high-powered rifles and explosives. Choosing the appropriate level will depend on your specific requirements and the threats you may face.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Is driving an armored car significantly different from driving a regular vehicle?</strong></h3>



<p>There may be some differences, as armored cars are typically heavier and have limited visibility. However, with proper training and familiarity with the vehicle, driving an armored car should not be drastically different from driving a regular car.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Can any type of car be armored?</strong></h3>



<p>The notion that armored cars for civilians only come as black, bulky, and&nbsp;<a href="https://troyarmoring.com/does-an-armored-car-or-suv-have-to-start-with-a-luxury-brand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">luxury vehicles</a>&nbsp;is a misconception. While these vehicles are commonly armored, outfitting a car with armor is possible for almost any make and model. The right company can customize and armor a car to meet your specific needs and preferences.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What should I look for in an armoring company?</strong></h3>



<p>When choosing an armoring company, it is essential to ensure they have experience and expertise in the industry. This includes understanding international ballistic standards and installing armoring without compromising the vehicle&#8217;s structural integrity. Choosing a firm with a solid track record and positive customer reviews is also important.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Can I buy pre-owned armored cars?</strong></h3>



<p>Yes, pre-owned armored cars can be a more affordable option. But just like buying a regular used car, it is important to thoroughly inspect the vehicle and armoring features before making a purchase. Choosing a trusted dealer with experience in selling pre-owned armored vehicles is also wise.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Are armored cars expensive to maintain?</strong></h3>



<p>An armored car will require regular maintenance and potential repairs like any vehicle. However, these costs should not be significantly higher than those for a regular car. Additionally, investing in an armored vehicle can save you money in the long run by protecting valuable cargo and reducing the risk of theft or damage.</p>
