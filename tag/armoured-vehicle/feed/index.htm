<p>When protecting the people who matter most, an <strong>armored SUV</strong> can be a game-changing addition to your personal or corporate fleet. While many solutions promise increased safety, few can rival the <strong>robust protection</strong> and everyday usability of an SUV. Below, we&#8217;ll explore five compelling reasons why investing in an armored SUV might be your most intelligent security decision ever.</p>



<p><strong>1. Versatility for Everyday Life</strong></p>



<p>One of the standout features of an <strong>armored SUV</strong> is its incredible <strong>versatility</strong>. SUVs already offer ample seating, generous cargo space, and off-road capabilities. When these practical benefits are combined with ballistic protection, you get a vehicle that blends seamlessly into daily life while shielding occupants from potential threats. Whether you&#8217;re doing the school run or commuting to the office, an armored SUV adds a layer of confidence and peace of mind that conventional vehicles can&#8217;t provide.</p>



<p><strong>2. Enhanced Road Presence and Durability</strong></p>



<p>SUVs are known for their <strong>commanding presence</strong> on the road. Their larger frames and higher stances give you a panoramic view of your surroundings and contribute to a more imposing look. This already sturdy platform becomes remarkably tough when reinforced with <strong>bullet-resistant materials</strong> and specialized glass. Every crucial area, from engine components to door frames, is fortified to resist ballistic impact. This robust construction translates to a vehicle designed to withstand daily wear and tear and the unexpected challenges of high-risk situations.</p>



<p><strong>3. Advanced Safety Features</strong></p>



<p>Modern SUVs have <strong>cutting-edge safety systems</strong>, from traction control to advanced driver-assistance technologies. Upgrading to an armored SUV builds upon these innovations to create a comprehensive shield for all occupants. You&#8217;ll typically find reinforced door panels, ballistic glass, and run-flat tires, which are standard in many professionally armored models. Integrating top-tier defence capabilities into an already safe platform ensures that your protective measures cover all angles—from roadside emergencies to more extreme security threats.</p>



<p><strong>4. Discreet Protection for High-Profile Individuals</strong></p>



<p>High-profile individuals—executives, celebrities, or government officials—often require elevated <strong>privacy and security</strong>. An <strong>armored SUV</strong> suits these needs well because it doesn&#8217;t draw unwanted attention. Most armoring solutions are designed to preserve the exterior appearance as much as possible, allowing you to move about with <strong>discretion</strong>. Instead of announcing your security measures to the world, you can blend in with traffic while still enjoying the significant benefits of a reinforced vehicle. This discreet approach can be a crucial advantage, especially when travelling to unfamiliar or high-risk areas.</p>



<p><strong>5. Trusted Expertise from Industry Leaders</strong></p>



<p>Investing in an armored SUV means placing great trust in the company responsible for fortifying it. When you turn to a reputable manufacturer, such as <a href="https://troyarmoring.com/suvs/">Troy Armoring</a>, you benefit from <strong>years of expertise</strong> and a track record of success. Their team meticulously tests each component—from the ballistic glass to the reinforced chassis—to ensure it meets rigorous safety standards. With expert consultation, you can select the precise level of armoring that suits your individual or organizational needs.</p>



<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong> In a world where <strong>security</strong> has become a top priority, an <strong>armored SUV</strong> is a versatile, durable, and discreet solution. Between its everyday practicality and its peace of mind, this vehicle represents an ideal blend of form and function. Whether transporting family members or important clients, an armored SUV can help you stay prepared for whatever challenges the road may bring. By partnering with a trusted manufacturer like Troy Armoring, you&#8217;ll gain a level of security that meets your highest expectations and ensures that everyone inside travels safely and comfortably, day in and day out.</p>

<p><strong>Armored vehicles</strong> have become essential tools for personal and corporate security. They offer increased protection in potentially volatile situations while maintaining convenience and comfort. In the United States, <strong>regulations</strong> surrounding armored vehicles vary by state, making it crucial to understand the <strong>local requirements</strong> before purchasing or operating one. Whether you’re searching for an <strong>armored SUV</strong> for secure family travel or an armored sedan for professional use, knowing these rules will help you make an informed choice.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Understanding the Regulatory Landscape</strong></h2>



<p>Each state has its own laws governing the <strong>ownership and operation</strong> of armored vehicles. These regulations can encompass everything from the process of registering the vehicle to the specifics of window tinting. Typically, owners must comply with <strong>federal safety standards</strong> that apply to all motor vehicles, along with additional, localized criteria—such as proof of purpose for the armored vehicle.</p>



<p>Before acquiring an <strong>armored SUV</strong>, consult your state&#8217;s Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) or an experienced legal advisor to clarify any special permits, labels, or documentation you might need. Doing your homework ahead of time helps you avoid unpleasant surprises and allows you to focus on the <strong>benefits</strong> that an armored vehicle can provide.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Differences from State to State</strong></h2>



<p>With so many different rules, the <strong>variations</strong> between states can be significant. For instance, some states may require specialized licensing for drivers who operate heavily armored vehicles, while others may have stringent requirements for ballistic-resistant glass. In regions with higher traffic congestion, additional guidelines might exist regarding maximum vehicle dimensions or weight limits.</p>



<p>Because regulations differ substantially across the country, <strong>vehicle owners</strong> sometimes find themselves adapting to new requirements if they travel frequently between states. If you plan to move or use your armored vehicle across various regions, it pays to prepare by reviewing the relevant laws or contacting local authorities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Certifications and Testing Requirements</strong></h2>



<p>To maintain the <strong>highest safety standards</strong>, manufacturers like <a href="https://troyarmoring.com/suvs/">Troy Armoring</a> rigorously test their vehicles to ensure they meet or exceed recognized industry benchmarks. These tests typically include <strong>ballistic standards</strong> (such as those outlined by the National Institute of Justice) and structural integrity evaluations. Many states and federal agencies look favorably upon vehicles that carry certifications from well-known testing organizations.</p>



<p>Whether you’re interested in an <strong>armored SUV</strong> or sedan from <a href="https://troyarmoring.com/sedans/">Troy Armoring</a>, you’ll benefit from this <strong>comprehensive testing</strong>. It serves as a seal of quality that can support any paperwork or inspections required by local authorities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Choosing the Right Armored SUV</strong></h2>



<p>An <strong>armored SUV</strong> is popular for those seeking comfort and robust security on the road. Adding interior space can accommodate family members, staff, or equipment while offering <strong>superior protection</strong>. However, selecting the right model involves more than just comparing prices. Consider the vehicle’s <strong>armor level</strong>, which relates to its protective capabilities, along with any specific local regulations on modifications—like ballistic glass thickness or run-flat tires—that might affect its eligibility for registration in your state.</p>



<p>Consulting with an experienced manufacturer or dealer, such as Troy Armoring, gives you access to professional advice on how best to navigate these <strong>regulatory hurdles</strong>. They can also support maintenance, repairs, and ongoing compliance with evolving state laws.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> </p>



<p>Navigating the local <strong>regulations and requirements</strong> for armored vehicles in the United States may seem daunting. However, with some research, expert guidance, and a reliable manufacturer, you can acquire a car that offers security, comfort, and peace of mind. From robust <strong>armored SUVs</strong> that carry your loved ones to specialized sedans crafted for executive travel, there&#8217;s no shortage of options for those looking to enhance their safety on the road. By staying informed and consulting the right professionals, you&#8217;ll be well on your way to confidently owning and operating your own <strong>armored vehicle</strong>.</p>

<p>For many of us, the mere mention of <em>armored vehicles</em> conjures up images of impenetrable tanks rolling across battlefields. But the world of armored cars is much more diverse and exciting than you might think. Today, we&#8217;re taking you inside these fortresses on wheels to uncover some of the most remarkable features you probably didn&#8217;t know armored cars had.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a><strong>Armor That’s Light As a Feather, But Tough As Nails</strong></h2>



<p>One of the first things that comes to mind when discussing armored cars is the <strong>armor</strong> itself. However, it&#8217;s sometimes about something other than the sheer weight. Modern armored vehicles use advanced materials that are surprisingly lightweight. <strong>Composite</strong> <strong>armors</strong> and advanced steel alloys provide ample protection without damaging the vehicle. This results in vehicles that are still nimble and easy to maneuver but can withstand bullets and explosions.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a><strong>Ballistic Glass: When Windows Act as Shields</strong></h2>



<p>This feature is captivating. The <strong>ballistic glass</strong> is not your average vehicle window. It comprises several layers of glass and polycarbonate, making it extraordinarily thick and highly resistant to bullets. Imagine driving with the confidence that your windows are built like shields!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a><strong>Run-Flat Tires: Keep Rolling Under Pressure</strong></h2>



<p>We all know how stressful a flat tire can be. Now imagine being in a hostile environment and facing that situation. This is why armored vehicles have <strong>run-flat tires</strong>. These fantastic pieces of technology can continue running for a certain distance even after they have been punctured, giving the vehicle&#8217;s occupants enough time to get to safety.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a><strong>Built-In Fire Suppression Systems: A Firewall on Wheels</strong></h2>



<p>Safety is the utmost priority in armored vehicles, and fire is among the deadliest threats. Some armored cars are equipped with <strong>built-in fire suppression systems.</strong> These systems detect and suppress the fire, ensuring the safety of the passengers. It&#8217;s like having a personal firefighter on board.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a><strong>Advanced Communication Systems: Stay Connected, Stay Safe</strong></h2>



<p>In critical situations, communication is vital. Armored vehicles often include <strong>advanced communication systems</strong> that ensure constant contact with the outside world, no matter how remote or dangerous the area may be. These features, from satellite phones to GPS tracking, are imperative in keeping you safe and informed.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a><strong>Secure Air Filtration: Protection Against the Unseen</strong></h2>



<p>Biological and chemical attacks are harrowing possibilities. Some armored vehicles take safety to the next level with <strong>secure air filtration systems.</strong> These systems purify the air entering the car, ensuring that occupants are safe from harmful substances.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a><strong>Luxury in Security: When Comfort Meets Protection</strong></h2>



<p>It&#8217;s a common misconception that armored vehicles are just about safety and utility. Many manufacturers, including Troy Armoring, ensure that the interior of their vehicles is as luxurious as any high-end car. Customized seating, climate control, and state-of-the-art entertainment systems are available.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><a></a><strong>Wrap Up</strong></h2>



<p>As we&#8217;ve seen, armored vehicles are not just metal giants made for combat. They are highly advanced, multi-faceted machines designed to ensure security and comfort. Whether it’s the lightweight armor, ballistic glass, or luxury interiors, these features work in tandem to provide an unmatched driving experience.</p>

<p>Armored sedans provide a great deal of protection, along with a luxury experience. After all, most armored sedans began as luxury or well-equipped sedans. From there, armored plates and other security features were added to keep the passengers and cargo secure. But who is a good candidate for an armored sedan?</p>



<p><strong>Political Leaders</strong></p>



<p>One of the most common uses for <a href="https://troyarmoring.com/sedans/"><strong>armored sedans</strong></a> is for political leaders. Presidents and prime ministers use armored sedans, but they aren’t only for political leaders on the national level. State leaders, mayors, and political leaders of smaller geographic areas can benefit from an armored sedan. After all, politicians can’t please everyone, and they need protection from disgruntled citizens.</p>



<p><strong>Business Leaders</strong></p>



<p>Business leaders, especially C-suite executives of major companies, are also good candidates for armored sedans. Some people may have bad intentions because of their fame or wealth. There is also the risk that someone will be unhappy with the actions of the company and choose to blame the C-suite executives. An armored sedan will protect business leaders in any of these situations.</p>



<p><strong>Celebrities</strong></p>



<p>Anyone with a high profile will attract a great deal of attention wherever they go. From direct threats against their safety to someone looking to break into the car and steal something, celebrities on all levels face various potential threats. But an armored car can mitigate most of these.</p>



<p><strong>High-net-worth Individuals</strong></p>



<p>High-net-worth individuals should also consider an armored sedan. People may try to kidnap them for ransom, steal from them, or hurt them in hopes of getting their wealth. The extra protection of an armored sedan gives high-net-worth individuals more peace of mind.</p>



<p><strong>People Transporting Valuables</strong></p>



<p>Armored sedans are also a good option for anyone transporting valuable items. Whether art, jewelry, money, or something else, transporting valuables in an armored vehicle reduces the risk of theft. After all, would-be thieves can’t break into the car or easily damage it in a collision with the goal of getting inside after.</p>



<p><strong>Anyone Looking for More Security</strong></p>



<p>While anyone in the above categories is a good candidate for an armored sedan, the reality is that they are also a good option for <a href="https://troyarmoring.com/why-an-armored-sedan-might-be-right-for-you/">anyone who wants additional security</a>. Armored vehicles are a good way to stay safe while maintaining a low profile. An armored sedan will not draw as much attention as other vehicles, such as an armored limo or SUV. Yet, you still get a high level of protection.</p>



<p>Given that most people who would want an armored vehicle are used to the finer things in life, you will find many armored versions of luxury sedans. But if you want to minimize attention, you can even opt for an armored Camry.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> </p>



<p>Armored sedans are incredibly popular among political leaders, business owners, C-suite executives, celebrities, and wealthy individuals. They are also commonly useful in transporting valuables. Nonetheless, anyone who wants to feel more secure should consider an armored sedan, even if it is because you live in a dangerous area.</p>

<p>In many ways, maintaining an <a href="https://troyarmoring.com/suvs/"><strong>armored SUV</strong></a> is very similar to maintaining any other vehicle. You need to change the car’s tires, wash it regularly, and inspect the various belts, hoses, and other components according to the owner’s manual. But some aspects of automotive maintenance are more important for armored vehicles than others.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Always Inspect the Tires and Wheels</strong></h2>



<p>While the <a href="https://troyarmoring.com/is-it-possible-to-patch-a-run-flat-tire/">tires</a> and wheels are important on any vehicle, this is especially true of armored vehicles. An issue with wheel alignment or a punctured or deflated tire can make your vehicle an easy target. Underinflated tires can also worsen handling, making it harder to control the armored vehicle. So, get in the habit of inspecting the tires regularly. If you are using an armored vehicle for a high-profile person, there is no such thing as inspecting the tires too frequently.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Keep an Eye on the Chassis</strong></h2>



<p>The chassis is one component of an armored SUV that will need more attention than a non-armored one. This comes from the additional weight of all the armored plates added to the vehicle. SUVs are carefully chosen before adding the plates to ensure they can handle the extra weight. Even so, you will need to inspect the chassis of an armored SUV more frequently than you would on a regular SUV.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Test the Brakes Regularly</strong></h3>



<p>Any vehicle should have its brakes checked regularly, whether or not it is armored. After all, brakes are one of the most important components for staying safe on the road, as they let you stop and avoid collisions.</p>



<p>But brakes on armored vehicles are a special consideration for a few reasons. To start, the security concerns that make you opt for an armored vehicle mean you want your SUV to be highly maneuverable. This way, you can count on its handling and braking to get you out of sticky situations.</p>



<p>Additionally, the brakes of armored vehicles are under additional pressure because of the added weight. As such, they could experience more wear than you would with a regular SUV.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Install and Maintain a GPS Tracker</strong></h3>



<p>While not necessarily maintenance, every armored SUV should have a GPS tracker. The people or items inside these SUVs are important enough to require extra protection. As such, it stands to reason that you also want to be able to find them at all times. A GPS tracker can prevent a would-be kidnapper or thief from being successful.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bonus: Ask Your Armored SUV Vendor for Any Special Instructions</strong></h4>



<p>The absolute best way to maintain your armored SUV is to <a href="https://troyarmoring.com/faq-everything-you-need-to-know-about-armored-cars/">ask</a> the manufacturer or vendor for special instructions. They will give you these instructions automatically when you buy the vehicle, but you can always ask for more information. Since their engineers handled the armored SUV’s conversion, they are the best equipped to know what maintenance it needs.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> </p>



<p>To maintain an armored SUV, you must follow all of the basic maintenance that you would for any other vehicle. But pay special attention to the tires, chassis, and brakes. When in doubt, ask the armored SUV manufacturer or vendor for any special maintenance required.</p>

<p>If you already have an armored SUV but aren’t using it all the time, consider turning it into a side hustle. You can easily rent it out when you aren’t using it. This will let you take advantage of the demand for rental armored SUVs and maximize your vehicle’s abilities.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>There Is High Demand</strong></h2>



<p>Whether or not you realize it, there is a high demand for rental <a href="https://troyarmoring.com/suvs/"><strong>armored SUVs</strong></a>. Many people are accustomed to using armored vehicles at home but don’t necessarily own one in every city. Driving the armored vehicle or having someone else do so is likely feasible for closer destinations. But if someone with an armored SUV travels more than a few hours, then they will likely want to rent one at their destination. This will be easier logistically and reduce the wear on their armored vehicle.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Rent to Rich, Influential, and Famous People</em></h3>



<p>The biggest customer base interested in renting your armored SUV would be those who are rich, influential, powerful, or famous. These people are likely to usually drive around in armored vehicles as a way to stay safe from physical harm, kidnapping, and theft. They will want this same level of security and safety when in your city as they experience at home.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><em>Rent to Civilians in Dangerous Areas</em></h3>



<p>Depending on where you live, you can also find an even wider range of people potentially interested in renting your SUV. This is especially true if you live close to or in a <a href="https://troyarmoring.com/5-most-dangerous-cities-in-canada/">dangerous</a> area, as travelers may want extra protection from an armored vehicle.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Rent It Out Based on Your Schedule</strong></h3>



<p>The great thing about renting out your armored SUV as a side hustle is that you can control the schedule. You can rent it out as much or as little as you want. You can even adapt how frequently you rent it out throughout the year.</p>



<p>For example, perhaps you are usually in town and use your armored SUV nearly every day. You could rent it out for a few hours or days here and there when you know you won’t need it. But then, when you go on vacation to another country and won’t use the armored SUV, you could rent it for weeks or even months. The rental schedule is entirely up to you.</p>



<p>You can even buy an armored SUV just to rent out and only occasionally use it yourself.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Choose a Luxurious Armored SUV to Expand Its Appeal</strong></h2>



<p>If you plan on renting your armored SUV and haven’t bought one yet, consider getting a more luxurious version. This will increase its appeal to renters and upgrade your experience every time you ride in or drive it.</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong> </p>



<p>Most people with armored SUVs don’t need to use them 24/7. Whether there are regular times every week when you don’t use the vehicle, or you are out of town for weeks at a time, consider renting it out when you don’t need it.</p>

<p>Back in the day, chainmail and steel plates protected riders and their horses from enemy attacks. But this was when the primary mode of transportation was on horseback, and the only threats were swords and arrows.</p>



<p>Now, we have advanced to using cars, and the threats have evolved to include bullets and explosions. With the artillery available to potentially hostile forces, it&#8217;s crucial to ensure your car is appropriately armored to protect you and your passengers. How do you know if your vehicle has the proper protection? The answer lies in understanding armor levels.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Armor Level Ratings</h3>



<p>Armor levels or&nbsp;<a href="https://troyarmoring.com/ballistic-protection-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ballistic protection levels</a>&nbsp;are ratings assigned to protective materials based on their ability to withstand attacks from certain weapons. These ratings are represented by the&nbsp;<a href="https://nij.ojp.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Institute of Justice</a>&nbsp;(NIJ) standard, a set of guidelines created in 1972 to ensure uniformity and consistency in the protection offered by body armor.</p>



<p>Each level corresponds to the type of ammunition it can resist. For example, B4 armor can protect against .357 Magnum and 9mm handguns and shotguns. B6 armor, on the other hand, can withstand attacks from high-power rifle rounds. The higher the level, the more protection offered.</p>



<p><strong>How to Choose the Right Armor Level Rating for Your Vehicle</strong></p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Assess Your Potential Threats&nbsp;</h3>



<p>What hostile forces are you most likely to encounter? Are they armed with handguns or high-powered rifles?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Different vehicle users&nbsp;may face various unique threats. For example, government officials and VIPs may need to protect against high-powered weapons. Meanwhile, a business executive in a low-crime area may only need to protect against handguns.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. The Vehicle You Drive</h3>



<p>Do you want to navigate the streets more efficiently with a&nbsp;<a href="https://troyarmoring.com/sedans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sedan</a>, or do you need an&nbsp;<a href="https://troyarmoring.com/suvs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SUV</a>&nbsp;for added protection and to accommodate more passengers?&nbsp;</p>



<p>While advancements in technology have resulted in lighter and more durable armor materials, make sure to also consider the weight of the added protection. Higher armor levels may require a larger and sturdier vehicle to support it.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Your Budget</h3>



<p>Should you splurge on the highest level of protection available, or is a lower level sufficient for your needs?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, armor-level ratings also come with varying price points. It&#8217;s essential to find a balance between the level of protection you need and what you can afford.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">4. Features and Add-ons</h3>



<p>Are there any additional features you may want to add?</p>



<p>Beyond armor levels, you can consider other features and add-ons for added security.&nbsp;<a href="https://troyarmoring.com/how-bulletproof-glass-works/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bulletproof glass</a>, run-flat tires, and an emergency evacuation system are just some options to further protect you in the event of an attack.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Takeaway</h3>



<p>Your safety and that of your passengers should always be a priority. Remember to assess your potential threats, choose a vehicle that can support added protection, consider your budget, and look into additional features and add-ons. With the right armor level, you can navigate the roads confidently, knowing that there is enough protection for you and your loved ones.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The image of an armored vehicle may come to mind as a dark, bulky tank-like machine. However, not all armored vehicles fit this stereotype. They may look like any other car or truck on the surface but have an impressive array of&nbsp;<a href="https://troyarmoring.com/four-safety-features-of-armored-vehicles-everyone-loves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">protective measures</a>&nbsp;beneath the exterior. From bulletproof glass to reinforced steel plating, these vehicles can withstand attacks from firearms and explosives.</p>



<p>So, how can you spot an armored vehicle on the road? There are telltale signs to look out for.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Less Bounce, More Weight</h3>



<p>Armored vehicles have reinforced suspensions to support the vehicle&#8217;s armor plating. These heavy-duty suspensions allow the handling of the added weight without compromising performance. This means that they will have less bounce and a notably stiffer suspension. You might not be able to spot this from just a passing glance. But if you notice the vehicle driving smoothly even on rough terrain, it could be a hint that it&#8217;s armored.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><br>Heavy-Duty Steel Frame</h3>



<p><a href="https://troyarmoring.com/why-are-armored-cars-more-secure-than-regular-autos-a-closer-look-at-the-differences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Regular cars</a>&nbsp;have a steel frame, but armored vehicles have an upgraded frame. This thicker, heavy-duty frame supports the added weight of armor plating without compromising the vehicle&#8217;s structural integrity. It also helps protect against explosive devices and ballistic attacks. It’s likely that you won’t be able to spot this feature just by looking at the vehicle but keep an eye out for any unusual bulges or unevenness in the car&#8217;s body.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Bulletproof Glass</h3>



<p>While regular cars usually only have layers of laminated glass for protection, armored vehicles have polycarbonate-coated glass that is much&nbsp;<a href="https://troyarmoring.com/how-thick-should-a-bulletproof-glass-be/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thicker</a>&nbsp;and heavier. You may notice this in the depth of the window frames and the sound the windows make when closed. The glass may also have a greenish or bluish tint, a telltale sign that it has been reinforced for protection. However, not all ballistic glass has this tint, so it&#8217;s not a foolproof way to spot an armored vehicle.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Run-Flat Tires</h3>



<p>Armored vehicles typically come equipped with run-flat tires, which allow the car to keep moving even after the tires are punctured. These tires have reinforced sidewalls and can support the weight of the armored vehicle without losing air pressure. They may appear bulkier than regular tires. Some also have unusual bulges that could indicate a built-in reinforcing ring.</p>



<p>But remember that not all armored vehicles have run-flat tires, and some regular cars may also have them for added protection.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Identifying Markers</h3>



<p>In some cases, companies that manufacture or outfit armored vehicles will place their logo or name on the car&#8217;s exterior. You can usually find this on the back bumper or driver&#8217;s side door.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Takeaway</h3>



<p>To someone who doesn&#8217;t know what to look for, an armored vehicle may blend in with regular cars on the road. So, if you&#8217;re thinking of investing in an armored vehicle for your protection, you can rest easy knowing that these features will keep you safe without drawing unwanted attention. You can choose to drive an inconspicuous&nbsp;<a href="https://troyarmoring.com/suvs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sedan</a>&nbsp;or a bulkier&nbsp;<a href="https://troyarmoring.com/suvs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SUV</a>, but no matter the exterior, you&#8217;ll have the peace of mind that your vehicle can withstand any danger.</p>
