But this was when the primary mode of transportation was on horseback, and the only threats were swords and arrows.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, we have advanced to using cars, and the threats have evolved to include bullets and explosions. With the artillery available to potentially hostile forces, it&#8217;s crucial to ensure your car is appropriately armored to protect you and your passengers. How do you know if your vehicle has the proper protection? The answer lies in understanding armor levels.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Armor Level Ratings<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Armor levels or&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/troyarmoring.com\/ballistic-protection-2\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ballistic protection levels<\/a>&nbsp;are ratings assigned to protective materials based on their ability to withstand attacks from certain weapons. These ratings are represented by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/nij.ojp.gov\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">National Institute of Justice<\/a>&nbsp;(NIJ) standard, a set of guidelines created in 1972 to ensure uniformity and consistency in the protection offered by body armor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each level corresponds to the type of ammunition it can resist. For example, B4 armor can protect against .357 Magnum and 9mm handguns and shotguns. B6 armor, on the other hand, can withstand attacks from high-power rifle rounds. The higher the level, the more protection offered.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How to Choose the Right Armor Level Rating for Your Vehicle<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">1. Assess Your Potential Threats&nbsp;<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What hostile forces are you most likely to encounter? Are they armed with handguns or high-powered rifles?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Different vehicle users&nbsp;may face various unique threats. For example, government officials and VIPs may need to protect against high-powered weapons. Meanwhile, a business executive in a low-crime area may only need to protect against handguns.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2. The Vehicle You Drive<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you want to navigate the streets more efficiently with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/troyarmoring.com\/sedans\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sedan<\/a>, or do you need an&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/troyarmoring.com\/suvs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SUV<\/a>&nbsp;for added protection and to accommodate more passengers?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While advancements in technology have resulted in lighter and more durable armor materials, make sure to also consider the weight of the added protection. Higher armor levels may require a larger and sturdier vehicle to support it.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">3. Your Budget<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Should you splurge on the highest level of protection available, or is a lower level sufficient for your needs?&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, armor-level ratings also come with varying price points. It&#8217;s essential to find a balance between the level of protection you need and what you can afford.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">4. Features and Add-ons<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Are there any additional features you may want to add?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond armor levels, you can consider other features and add-ons for added security.&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/troyarmoring.com\/how-bulletproof-glass-works\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bulletproof glass<\/a>, run-flat tires, and an emergency evacuation system are just some options to further protect you in the event of an attack.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Takeaway<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Your safety and that of your passengers should always be a priority. Remember to assess your potential threats, choose a vehicle that can support added protection, consider your budget, and look into additional features and add-ons. With the right armor level, you can navigate the roads confidently, knowing that there is enough protection for you and your loved ones.
