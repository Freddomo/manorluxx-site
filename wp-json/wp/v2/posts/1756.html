I saw a dog come out, which was very cute. The next thing I saw was a man with a gun.<\/p>\n<p>“I said, ‘Isn’t that a gun?’ and as soon as I said that, the driver angled the car and floored it. That’s when we saw six men, all of them brandishing machine guns.<\/p>\n<p>“My driver was a legend. He bounced off about five cars. We were driving over the top of them. It was very scary. I don’t know whether they knew who it was they were ambushing. But I am glad I didn’t have my girlfriend Jessica (Michibata) with me. She would have been terrified.”<\/p>\n<p>Additional security measures have now been put in place to ensure the safety of all drivers in Brazil for the
