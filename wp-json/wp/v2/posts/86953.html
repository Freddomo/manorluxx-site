We are NOT a company from the United Arab Emirates, nor do we have, or ever had any operations in the UAE. There is a false entity in Dubai, illegally using our brand name \u2013 this matter is well known, it is subject to litigation, and we have won at every turn, and will continue to win \u2013 there is only one Manorluxx, and it has been located in Canada for the past 27 years.<\/p>\n<p>Anyone making claims to the contrary, is simply uninformed, and the claims about\u00a0us not manufacturing are pathetic \u2013 Haiti National Police officials have visited our\u00a0factory, and so did State Department officials (not only in connection with this\u00a0transaction). Videos of our facilities are freely available on the internet.<\/p>\n<p>2.\u00a0Making claims about us having received 100% of the payment up front, are also incorrect \u00a0and frankly insulting \u2013 we have spent an inordinate amount of money on this deal, and we are currently in a loss. We only received a down payment, and have been spending our own money ever since. Perhaps the self same \u201cjournalists\u201d should investigate their own government\u2019s payment policies.<\/p>\n<p>3. The delays in delivery are based on supply chain issues \u2013 the whole world, and the entire automotive industry is suffering from it \u2013 we\u2019ve been very transparent from the outset, on every issue, and we did not hide. \u00a0We have been spending time in <a href=\"https:\/\/Manorluxxarmored.com\/haiti\/\">Haiti<\/a>, meeting with politicians and police alike, every step of the way.<\/p>\n<p>If Volkswagen Audi, and General Motors cannot deliver vehicles, and Ford has\u00a0waiting times exceeding 1 year, what could a smaller manufacturer do, but try\u00a0their best?<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve had vehicles in stock, when this deal was underway, however as there was\u00a0no signed contract, and subsequently no payment, the vehicles went elsewhere. This is the way\u00a0 business is done, and any and all accusations against us for unfair business\u00a0practices, are simply preposterous.<\/p>\n<p>4. Last, but not least, there are constant claims of a mysterious US manufacturer that was ready to supply MRAPs. It is \u00a0interesting that it is never mentioned by name \u2013 possibly because it does not exist, but it conveniently fits the narrative. There are no \u201creal\u201d armoured vehicle manufacturers in New York, and especially none that make MRAPs.<\/p>\n<p>The American (and US) governments, have been incredibly supportive of our\u00a0efforts, and of Haiti\u2019s plight, providing military aircraft for these emergency airlifts. \u00a0Unsubstantiated claims\u00a0of self interest are patently baseless and an attempt by various\u00a0\u201cpundits\u201d to generate readership. In simple terms it is called \u201cclick bait\u201d and \u201clink\u00a0bait\u201d. Instead of fabricating stories, those who fancy themselves as journalists,\u00a0should actually do real research, and not manufacture supposed facts.<\/p>\n<p>We stand with the Haitian National Police, and the people of Haiti and we continue to\u00a0support them, to the best of our ability, and beyond.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We are pained to learn, that certain news outlets in Haiti believe they have a free license to spread vile lies about our organization, about our activities, and most of all about our obligations.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve always tried to keep a [â€¦]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":12,"featured_media":86954,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_acf_changed":false,"inline_featured_image":false,"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_active":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_note":"","_monsterinsights_sitenote_category":0,"footnotes":""},"categories":[42],"tags":[],"acf":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v23.5 -
