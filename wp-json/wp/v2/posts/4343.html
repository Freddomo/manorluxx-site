The result is a glass-like material that is thicker and safer than normal glass.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of window protection, INKAS\u00ae armored vehicles for sale employ a new generation of bulletproof glass, which is more transparent in comparison with other ballistic glass available on the market all while maintaining the necessary ballistic properties. If live bullets were to be fired into INKAS\u00ae bullet proof windows, it would pierce the outside layer of the glass, but the layer of tough plastic would absorb the bullet’s energy and stop it before it could exit the final layer of glass.<\/p>\n<p>INKAS\u00ae Armored Vehicle Manufacturing is a leading American-based company that specializes in the design and production of a wide range of armored vehicles, including executive SUVs, luxury sedans, special purpose vehicles, personnel carriers, cash-in-transit vehicles, and others.
