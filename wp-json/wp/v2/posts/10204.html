The new Sentry MPV is a product of advanced development and unique technical design and has made its debut at Canada\u2019s Global Defence and Security Trade Show, May 30-31, 2018.<\/p>\n<p>This new iteration built upon the Sentry APC platform was designed to add more flexibility and customization options while still maintaining the superior protection and comfort one expects from an INKAS\u00ae armored vehicle. Using mission-tested solutions, INKAS\u00ae has improved upon previous models to design a vehicle able to adapt to any environment. Due to its lighter size and advanced off-road capabilities, the new Sentry MPV can get on site faster, making it an ideal solution for first responders, law enforcement, SWAT, and border control agencies.<\/p>\n<p>The new Sentry model can accommodate four to six people including the driver, and the configurable seating arrangements allow occupants to operate the MPV while maintaining all tactical positions. The INKAS\u00ae Sentry MPV is also lighter than a traditional Sentry APC, which increases its maneuverability while keeping its occupants comfortable in almost any climate and terrain.<\/p>\n<p>The brand-new innovative design language has produced a multipurpose armored vehicle with a “pick-up truck” style rear bed that is true to the reliability and adaptability congruent with the INKAS\u00ae brand. Whether it is used for transport and maintenance operations, rescue and medical evacuations, personal transport, or surveillance, the Sentry MPV is flexible to suit any mission.<\/p>\n<p>Additional technical details for the Sentry MPV include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Armor level: BR7<\/li>\n<li>Transmission: 6-Speed Automatic<\/li>\n<li>Engine: 6.7L 8-cyl Turbo Diesel<\/li>\n<li>Horsepower: 390 HP @ 2,800 rpm<\/li>\n<li>Torque: 800 ft. lb. @ 1,600 rpm<\/li>\n<li>Drivetrain: 4×4 with manual selector<\/li>\n<li>Wheelbase: 3,576 mm<\/li>\n<li>Ground clearance: 240mm<\/li>\n<li>Dimensions (LxWxH): 5,766 mm x 2,489 mm x 2,464 mm (without turret)<\/li>\n<li>Max speed: 140km\/h<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Currently in stock, the Sentry MPV is available to be shipped around the globe and has a range of customizable options. The Sentry MPV can be modified to the specific needs of every buyer with the addition of:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>360\u00b0 turret<\/li>\n<li>Acoustic hailing speaker<\/li>\n<li>Electronic winch<\/li>\n<li>Night vision<\/li>\n<li>Escape hatches<\/li>\n<li>Front-mounted plow or barrier system for obstacle clearance and crowd control<\/li>\n<li>Wire mesh reinforced windows<\/li>\n<li>An externally facing siren, public address system, and emergency lights all controlled within the cabin<\/li>\n<li>Complete engine bay and mechanical component armoring<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Advanced surveillance features allow the Sentry MPV to remain one of the best on the market in tactical reconnaissance. Custom observation systems include data collection, high-powered observation with trunk-mounted scope, complete elimination of all running lights, and external view cameras with a 360\u00b0 field of view. The capabilities of the newest Sentry model also include signal jamming, detection of firing sources with positive identification in under one second, and protection against nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons.<\/p>\n<p>INKAS\u00ae once again has designed an armored vehicle that marries mission-tested innovative technology with rugged armoring to deliver both safety and comfort. Tested to meet up to NIJ-STD-0108.01 Level IV and CEN Level BR7 ballistic standards, the Sentry MPV is well-equipped to handle anything in its path.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>At this year\u2019s CANSEC conference, INKAS\u00ae unveiled its brand-new Sentry Multi-Purpose Vehicle (MPV).
