When the ambassador refused to follow their orders and made an attempt to drive away from the scene, the offenders started shooting at ambassador\u2019s car.<\/p>\n<p>Broken glass shards from the gunshots damaged diplomat\u2019s face, however the ambassador and his wife successfully escaped and hid in a nearby shop where the policeman arrived shortly.<br \/>\nAccording to the interviewee, the participants in an attempt to kidnap the diplomat could be either the members of the local tribes who just saw the diplomat\u2019s plates or the representatives of \u201cAl-Qaeda\u201d group who hoped to get the bailout.<\/p>\n<p>In March 2012, the diplomat of the United Arab Emirates was kidnapped on the south of Yemen. The Yemen\u2019s part of \u201cAl-Qaeda\u201d group who organized the kidnapping demanded to liberate the members of this terroristic organization. \u201cAl-Qaeda\u201d group members were in the prison of UAE at that time.
