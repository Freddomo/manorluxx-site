And that sums up a few myths about armored cars that we&#8217;re here to debunk.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In reality, armored cars have come a long way since their early days. They have become popular among a wide range of people for their\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/troyarmoring.com\/four-safety-features-of-armored-vehicles-everyone-loves\/\">safety features<\/a>\u00a0and stylish designs. So, to separate the myths from the facts, here&#8217;s a list of the top five myths about armored cars.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Myth #1: Armored Cars Are Only for the Rich and Famous<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Armored cars have long been considered a symbol of wealth and power. That&#8217;s because, in the past, only the elite could afford to have one. But thanks to advancements in technology and manufacturing, that is no longer the case.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, various armored cars are available at different price points. Whether you&#8217;re looking for a luxurious and secured ride or a more budget-friendly option, you can find an armored car that meets your needs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Myth #2: Armored Cars Are Difficult to Drive<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact is that most armored cars are built on regular cars or SUV chassis. That means they handle and drive just like any other vehicle. The only difference is that they tend to be heavier than their unarmored counterparts. This is because of the steel reinforcement and other materials that help protect the occupants from bullets and other threats.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Myth #3:\u00a0<\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/troyarmoring.com\/does-an-armored-car-or-suv-have-to-start-with-a-luxury-brand\/\"><strong>Armored Cars Have to Be from a Luxury Brand<\/strong><\/a><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This myth stems from the belief that armored cars are only for the wealthy. While it&#8217;s true that many luxury brands offer armored vehicles, there are also many more affordable options available. From&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/troyarmoring.com\/sedans\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sedans<\/a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/troyarmoring.com\/suvs\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SUVs<\/a>, there&#8217;s an armored car for everyone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Myth #4: It&#8217;s a One Size Fits All Situation<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to armored cars, there is no such thing as a &#8220;one size fits all&#8221; solution. The level of security you need during transportation will depend on several factors, including your job, the places you frequent, and your security concerns. That&#8217;s why there are different levels of\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/troyarmoring.com\/ballistic-protection-2\/\">ballistic protection<\/a>\u00a0available for armored cars.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can choose the level of security and defense that best suits your needs, whether light, medium, or heavy-duty armor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Myth #5: There&#8217;s No Need for an Armored Car<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For the average person, an armored car may seem like a needless expense. But we&#8217;re living in a world where violence and crime are all too common. And while we hope we&#8217;ll never need the level of protection an armored car offers, it&#8217;s always better to be safe than sorry.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Takeaway<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>All that said, we hope that you now have a better understanding of these vehicles and their capabilities. The bottom line is that armored cars are a smart investment for anyone who wants to protect themselves and their loved ones. From the wealthy to the average Joe, there&#8217;s an armored car out there that meets your needs. So don&#8217;t let the myths deter you\u2014get the facts and make the decision that&#8217;s best for you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When some people hear the phrase &#8220;armored car,&#8221; they often picture a large, bulky vehicle that is difficult to maneuver and too expensive for the average person.
