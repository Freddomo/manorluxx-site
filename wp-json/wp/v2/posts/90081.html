Research indicates that by 2026, the market for these vehicles should grow to $21.97 billion. This sudden growth results from civilians’ increasing interest in armored automobiles.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A few years back, such vehicles were only accessible to banks, heads of state, and renowned athletes, among others, but nowadays, armored cars are even accessible to civilians. In this blog post, we have listed some of the top-notch vehicles for civilian use, allowing you to opt for the one that best fits your needs and budget. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">Who Can Buy Civilian Armored Vehicles?<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Civilian armored vehicles are not confined to a single demographic; rather, they serve a wide range of individuals and entities with unique needs and inclinations. These customized cars appeal to a diverse audience, including high-net-worth people and CEOs, government officials, celebrities, and even families living in high-security zones.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The importance of personal safety reaches a whole new tangent when it comes to high-profile people who opt for armored vehicles to lower any potential threats to their security. Aside from physical protection, armored cars provide them with inconspicuous transportation, fitting seamlessly into their lifestyle.<\/p>\n<p>Armored vehicles are also used by police officers and government personnel for a variety of tasks where they guarantee the security and safety of authorities in high-risk situations.<\/p>\n<p>On top of that, residents residing in areas afflicted by crime, civil upheaval, or political turmoil should consider purchasing armored vehicles to defend themselves and their families. These cars provide an extra degree of security against any dangers, whether one is traveling through hazardous metropolitan areas or distant locations with poor infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>The degree of protection needed, the possibilities for customization, and the basic vehicle chosen all affect how much armored vehicles cost. In addition to the vehicle’s standard price, armoring kits can cost anywhere from $30,000 to $90,000 or more. When compared to the possible hazards and perils of being unprotected under unpredictably changing conditions, this seemingly huge expense turns out to be little.<\/p>\n<h2><\/h2>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">Factors Affecting the Cost of Armored Vehicles<\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An armored vehicle’s overall cost is heavily influenced by the amount of protection required and the materials utilized. The ultimate cost may also increase with customization choices like runflat tires, strengthened glass, and cutting-edge security systems. Let us look at them in detail:<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Customization Level for Your Car<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Various kinds of armored vehicles are available specifically for civilian use, allowing customers to opt for additional customization levels per their preference. This includes upgrading the comfort, performance, or security features that may increase the overall cost of the vehicle.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For example, if you decide to install partitioning walls with sliding LED screens for passenger cells, automatic fire extinguishing systems, sliding armored sunroofs, special leather seats, etc., you will be charged an additional cost for all the customizations you have opted for.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><b>Safety Standards for Civilian Armored Vehicles<br \/>\n<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A diverse selection of armored vehicles is accessible for civilian purposes, encompassing SUVs, sedans, luxury vehicles, and trucks. These automobiles can be adjusted to deliver various levels of protection, which are meant to upgrade the security level of the occupants against different threats.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organizations such as the European Committee for Standardization (EN) and the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) in the United States are the two leading establishments that set these standards. EN 1522\/1523 is used for bullet-resistant doors, whereas EN 1063 is designed for glass-in-building security (armored vehicle transparency).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some other renowned standards and grades are also used to certify civilian armored vehicles, including VPAM (Vereinigung der Pr\u00fcfstellen f\u00fcr angriffshemmende Materialien und Konstruktionen) (in Germany), with grades like PM4 to PM9 and VR4 to VR10 for armoring levels. In contrast, the USA uses NIJ standards, and the UK aligns with European norms.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 class=\"p1\">Armored Vehicles: <strong>Models and Pricing<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The market is loaded with different kinds of armored vehicle models. Here are some of the finest models for civilian uses:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-90095 size-full\" style=\"font-family: 'open sans', sans-serif;\" src=\"https:\/\/Manorluxxarmored.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Manorluxx-Armored-Stretched-Limos-1.webp\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\" srcset=\"https:\/\/Manorluxxarmored.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Manorluxx-Armored-Stretched-Limos-1.webp 1200w, https:\/\/Manorluxxarmored.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Manorluxx-Armored-Stretched-Limos-1-300x158.webp 300w, https:\/\/Manorluxxarmored.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Manorluxx-Armored-Stretched-Limos-1-1024x538.webp 1024w, https:\/\/Manorluxxarmored.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Manorluxx-Armored-Stretched-Limos-1-768x403.webp 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><b>1.

Sedans\u00a0<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Civilians highly favor armored sedans due to their striking appearance and superior security features.

Armored Trucks<\/b><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Armored trucks are another category of vehicles that deliver high ballistic and explosive protection.

Basic armored trucks can range from $100,000 to $200,000, whereas high-level armored trucks with advanced protection may range from $400,000 to $1 million or more. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Civilian armored vehicles have attained much recognition in the past few years.
