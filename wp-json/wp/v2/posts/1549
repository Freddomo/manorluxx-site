After all, it\u2019s the tires that provide traction and maneuverability on the road. But not all tires are created equal. For armored vehicles, run-flat tires are essential.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\u2019s look at how this type of tire works, how it benefits armored cars, and why you might want to consider them for your vehicle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What Are Run-flat Tires?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Run-flat tires can maintain their integrity after getting punctured or going flat. For instance, a bullet could pierce the tread of a run-flat tire and cause it to deflate, but it would not result in an immediate blowout or loss of control. Because of this unique feature, these tires allow you to continue driving even when you\u2019ve been hit or have a flat.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Run-flat Tires Vs. Conventional Tires<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Run-flat tires are more durable than conventional tires thanks to two key factors: their reinforced sidewalls and internal support rings. The reinforced sidewalls help maintain stability and control in the event of a puncture or blowout. And the internal support rings provide additional strength and structure.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Why Your Armored Car Needs Run-flat Tires<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A few key benefits of run-flat tires make them essential for armored cars. These include:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em>Increased Safety<\/em><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Since these tires can withstand accidents and impacts, they provide extra protection for the car and its occupants. So, if the tire goes flat, the driver and passengers can rest easy knowing the tires will not deflate right away and leave them stranded.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em>Better Performance<\/em><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Since these tires have reinforced sidewalls, they have a higher load capacity than conventional tires. That means they can safely carry more weight while still ensuring optimal performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em>Increased Reliability<\/em><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Since run-flat tires can withstand the impacts that cause a tire blowout or other damage, they last longer than conventional tires. As such, armored cars with run-<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>flat tires can drive further and more reliably without a need for frequent replacement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em>No Spare Tire Needed<\/em><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Since run-flat tires retain air pressure even after a puncture, armored cars with these tires do not require a spare tire. This saves you time when it comes to regular maintenance and handling emergencies. As a bonus, you get more storage space in your vehicle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Should You Invest in Run-flat Tires for Your Armored Car?<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you own an armored car, run-flat tires are worth considering. They provide added protection and peace of mind, ensuring reliability and performance under even the most extreme driving conditions. So, if you want a fail-safe way to protect yourself and your passengers, run-flat tires are the best investment you can make.<em>Still in the market for a car that can withstand anything?&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/troyarmoring.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Troy Armoring<\/em><\/a><em>&nbsp;<\/em><em>offers some of the most trusted armored vehicles on the market, with various options to suit your needs.
