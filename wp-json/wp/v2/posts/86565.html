For example, you may live in a dangerous place or want peace of mind for yourself and\u00a0your family\u00a0when driving around town. Armored cars can keep you and your family safe from\u00a0carjackings, kidnappings, gunfire, and more.<\/p>\n<p>Buying a bulletproof car is becoming a more popular option with all the\u00a0chaos in the world\u00a0today, but exactly how much does a bulletproof car cost? What features does it have that make it so safe? And what determines the price of the car? Let’s answer some of those questions.[\/vc_column_text][vc_single_image image=”86812″ img_size=”full”][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h2>What is the Average Price of an Armored Car?<\/h2>\n<p>Armored car prices can vary depending on the amount of protective features within the car and the options that are added to the vehicle. They can, on average, run anywhere from $50,000 to $100,000 just for the armoring, depending on the level of protection and customization. That may sound like a lot, however, when your life is at risk, the last thing you want is a car that was made with inferior materials. Here is a breakdown of the main factors that affect an armored vehicle’s price:<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Level of Protection<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>How heavily armored do you need your vehicle to be? Armored cars can safeguard you from high-powered rifles with armor-piercing bullets, as well as blasts from grenades. The level of security you feel you need will be based on the threat you are facing.\u00a0However, the heavier the armoring level, the more expensive the vehicle will be.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Model of the Vehicle<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Some vehicles are easier to armor than others, and some require more skill to maintain its original performance level. The more intricate the details, the more the price increases. For example, luxury models are more difficult to armor and can cost up to 20% more than other vehicles.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Country of Manufacture<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Armoring a vehicle costs more in some countries than in others due to factors such as shipping costs, skilled labor, and importation of parts. These factors can increase your cost by up to 30% in some countries.<\/p>\n<p>Another option is to buy a used armored car, but as we\u2019ll discuss below, it may not be a good option. It might serve the same purpose at a lesser price tag, but the risks generally outweigh the benefits.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row css=”.vc_custom_1701717937142{background-color: #f7f7f7 !important;}” el_class=”gallery-wrapper”][vc_column][vc_column_text css=”.vc_custom_1729192232488{margin-top: 0px !important;margin-bottom: 0px !important;}”]\r\n\t\t\t<div id=\"gallery-id-89453\" class=\"acx-multimedia-gallery acx-shortcode splide gallery-type-default scroll-direction-horizontal\" data-thumb-interaction=\"click-only\" data-spinner-type=\"plane\" data-spinner-color=\"#ffffff\" style=\"--multimedia-gallery-thumb-opacity: 0.4\">\r\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"acx-widget__body\">\t\t\t\t\t\t<figure class=\"media-viewer\" data-ratio=\"3:2\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t<a class=\"mfp-link\" href=\"https:\/\/Manorluxxarmored.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Manorluxx-Armored-Cadillac-Escalade-1.jpg\" data-pos=\"1\" data-gall=\"mmg-89453\" aria-label=\"View larger image\" style=\"background-image: url(https:\/\/Manorluxxarmored.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Manorluxx-Armored-Cadillac-Escalade-1.jpg);

For example, at Manorluxx, we use high-grade certified ballistic steel and bulletproof windows, as well as carefully reinforce\u00a0the suspension to hold the extra weight of the heavy armoring. Here are a few of the key security features included in our armored vehicles:<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Full Protection From All Sides<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>This ensures all-around security, keeping passengers completely safe. The car is equipped with ballistic\u00a0steel plating throughout, shatterproof ballistic glass, reinforced critical structure points such as fuel tanks, and proprietary security features. These elements all work together to ensure full-perimeter security\u00a0while in the vehicle.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Underbody Armoring<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Our underbody armoring\u00a0protects from blasts underneath the car, safeguarding passengers from up to two DM51 hand grenades denoted simultaneously.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Ballistic Glass<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>This glass is\u00a0shatterproof from every angle, providing complete protection. However, it still allows you to\u00a0maintain a clear view so you can see what is happening around you. Carefully crafted, it replicates the curve of the OEM model, making it look no different than a regular car window.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Discreet Armoring<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>In order to not attract attention to yourself, your vehicle should not publicize to the world that it has been armored. We meticulously employ precision engineering to replicate the original OEM model, so your armor goes undetected by the public.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Door Assist<\/strong> <strong>Technology<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Vehicle armor is heavy. We put in counterbalances to support the\u00a0weight of the armored door, for effortless door opening.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Door Locking Mechanism<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>A bulletproof car can only protect you if it keeps you safe inside and prevents forced entry. Our door-locking mechanism is a\u00a0proprietary system and protects passengers from brute-force entry attempts.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Door Overlap System<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>The seams of your doors are a vulnerable point in your vehicle. We prevent\u00a0your door seams from ammunition penetration, keeping you safe inside the car.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Door Reinforcement<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Reinforcing your doors is\u00a0important for your safety.\u00a0With heavy-duty hinges and ballistic plating, we make sure they are completely bulletproof.<\/p>\n<h4><strong>Luxury Finishes<\/strong><\/h4>\n<p>Last but not least, no vehicle would be complete without the\u00a0premium features you’ve become accustomed to, so we only use the finest materials and masterful craftsmanship to produce high-end interiors.[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row css=”.vc_custom_1701717924196{background-color: #f7f7f7 !important;}” el_class=”gallery-wrapper”][vc_column][vc_column_text css=”.vc_custom_1729192239480{margin-top: 0px !important;margin-bottom: 0px !important;}”][\/vc_column_text][vc_column_text css=”.vc_custom_1701718185564{margin-top: 0px !important;margin-bottom: 0px !important;}”]Gallery: BR6 Ballistic Glass, Driver-Side Overlap, Rear Bulkhead Glass, PA System Controller, Reinforced Suspension[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]<\/p>\n<h2>Armored Vehicle Cost vs. Quality<\/h2>\n<p>Your life is the most valuable thing you have, and it’s irreplaceable. So while armored cars are more expensive than a normal car, it’s definitely worth it when you’re talking about saving your life.<\/p>\n<p>Now that you know the average price and what to expect, make sure you are looking for a reputable company to manufacture your bulletproof car. As with anything, some companies and people will undercut the price and use low-quality\u00a0materials in their outfitting. Be sure to check the company’s certifications and reputation.<\/p>\n<h2>What is the Price of Used Armored Cars?<\/h2>\n<p>Buying an armored car is a priceless expense. As we mentioned above, buying a used armored car is an option if you’re looking to\u00a0save some money on the price of your armored vehicle. The question that often gets asked is: <strong>Is it worth it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Bulletproof vehicles have a shorter lifespan than other vehicles, typically only three to five years, because the armoring is extremely heavy on the car’s suspension. The vehicle can be reinforced, but that only pushes the lifespan to just over five years. If buying a used armored vehicle, make sure you find out the history of the vehicle and know exactly when it was armored. A ten-year-old vehicle is not worth the risk when talking about your life.<\/p>\n<h2>Buy Your Armored Vehicle from a Leader in the Industry<\/h2>\n<p>The decision to buy an armored car should not be taken lightly. When you choose to do so, you’ll want to look for a company that has experience and expertise in the industry, such as\u00a0Manorluxx Armored Vehicle Manufacturing \u2013 a global leader in bulletproof car manufacturing, specializing in the design and production\u00a0of luxury armored cars, trucks, SUVs, sedans, and special purpose vehicles.<\/p>\n<p>Renowned for our high-quality engineering, Manorluxx vehicles are certified to B6+ levels, and includes a lineup of VPAM certified vehicles \u2013 a third-party certification which has only\u00a0been achieved\u00a0by 5% of armored car manufacturers in the world.<\/p>\n<p>We have implemented state-of-the-art technological innovations\u00a0into our armored vehicles and continue to\u00a0invest in the research and development of new technologies to keep our clients safe.\u00a0With a proven track record, Manorluxx has been providing vehicles to the United Nations, United States Government,\u00a0NATO,\u00a0law enforcement agencies, special forces, corporations, and high net-worth individuals\u00a0since 2000.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking to buy an armored vehicle, <a href=\"https:\/\/Manorluxxarmored.com\/contact-us\/?roistat_visit=139668\">contact<\/a> our experts!
