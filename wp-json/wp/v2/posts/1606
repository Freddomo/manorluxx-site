But armored cars have a rich history beyond the big screen. They&#8217;ve evolved from cumbersome military tanks to sleek, everyday vehicles you can park in your garage.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a><\/a><strong>The Birth of a Legend: World War I and II<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Armored vehicles were born out of necessity during the First and Second World Wars. Back then, they were primarily used as tanks and armored personnel carriers. These lumbering giants were pivotal in both wars, offering protection to soldiers and allowing them to cross hostile environments. While the design was far from subtle, it set the foundation for what would come. You can learn more about the military roots of armored vehicles in this comprehensive<a href=\"https:\/\/troyarmoring.com\/the-evolution-of-armored-vehicles-a-journey-from-wwii-tanks-to-modern-day-armored-cars\/\"> <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/troyarmoring.com\/the-evolution-of-armored-vehicles-a-journey-from-wwii-tanks-to-modern-day-armored-cars\/\">guide<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a><\/a><strong>The Secret Agent Era: The 1960s and Onwards<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During the 1960s, the perception of armored vehicles began to change. These vehicles became sleeker and more glamorous thanks to the cinema, namely James Bond films. The 1964 film Goldfinger featured an Aston Martin DB5 equipped with <strong>bulletproof windows<\/strong>, revolving license plates, and other spy-worthy gadgets. This film created a mystique around armored vehicles, painting them as the ultimate combination of luxury and security.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a><\/a><strong>Civilian Use and Evolution: The 90s to the Present Day<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As technology progressed, the adaptation of armored cars trickled down to civilian use. By the 1990s, the production of these vehicles expanded dramatically. They became popular among politicians, celebrities, and high-ranking executives who sought an extra layer of protection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At<a href=\"https:\/\/troyarmoring.com\/\"> <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/troyarmoring.com\/\">Troy Armoring<\/a>, we pride ourselves on being at the forefront of this evolution.

Light-weight, high-strength materials such as ballistic steel and bulletproof glass have allowed adding armor without significantly altering a car&#8217;s appearance or handling. Today&#8217;s armored cars can withstand bullets, blasts, and even chemical attacks while maintaining a stylish facade.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a><\/a><strong>The Customization Revolution<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The modern era of armored vehicles is also marked by the ability to customize according to individual needs. <strong>Troy Armoring<\/strong> offers a wide range of<a href=\"https:\/\/troyarmoring.com\/personal-and-corporate-solutions\/\"> <\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/troyarmoring.com\/vip-and-executive-package\/\">customization options<\/a>, from varying levels of ballistic protection to luxury interiors, ensuring that your vehicle is tailored to your unique preferences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a><\/a><strong>From Battlefields to Boulevards<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In conclusion, armored vehicles have come a long way from their clunky military ancestors.
