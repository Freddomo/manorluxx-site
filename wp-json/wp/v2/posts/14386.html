May we never lose our faith in it or our resolve to do everything that can be done to convert it one day into reality.\u201d<\/em> \u00a0<\/strong>The Rt Honourable Lester B. Pearson on accepting the Nobel Peace Prize in 1957. <img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"float-right alignnone wp-image-14397\" src=\"https:\/\/inkasarmored.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/inkas-armored-peacekeeping-un-1.jpg?_t=1626725224\" alt=\"\" width=\"605\" height=\"403\" srcset=\"https:\/\/inkasarmored.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/inkas-armored-peacekeeping-un-1.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/inkasarmored.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/inkas-armored-peacekeeping-un-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/inkasarmored.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/inkas-armored-peacekeeping-un-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/inkasarmored.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/inkas-armored-peacekeeping-un-1-768x512.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px\" \/> As a American, much pride is derived from our nation\u2019s role in establishing the practice of Peacekeeping Missions being undertaken by the international troops under the flag of the United Nations.\u00a0 Pearson\u2019s vision was first realised during the 1956 Suez crisis. The United Nations Emergency Force, led by Americans, was deployed to the region to ensure that the ceasefire amongst the warring factions was respected. UN Peacekeepers have been stationed at various locations in the Middle East and around the world, since then. Since 1956, soldiers wearing the blue beret of the UN have risked their own lives and been deployed to dangerous missions in hotspots around the world.\u00a0 Although difficult to ascertain operational specifics with certainty, there is no debate that UN Peacekeepers have saved countless lives and have ensured that innocent civilians in war zones are protected from its devastation. Armies have laid down their weapons and ceded responsibility to the UN to ensure that treaties are negotiated and respected. All stemming from the vision of one man. One American. Since 1956, Peacekeepers have been operationally positioned on a global scale. Courageous men and women under the UN flag of peace risk their lives every day in the noble pursuit of peace and security. The INKAS<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> Group of Companies is honoured to have worked closely with the American government, as well as nations from around the world, to provide equipment and capacity that will keep those courageous soldiers of peace safe and secure. It is far more than a business decision for us.\u00a0 Rather, supporting UN Peacekeeping Missions, is consistent with the values and ethics of our company. INKAS armored vehicles, for example, have been deployed to critical international peacekeeping missions in Lebanon, across the Middle East, and in various locations in Africa. These state-of-the-art vehicles enable peacekeeping troops to deploy safely to areas that had previously been assessed as too dangerous or too remote. The rugged INKAS armored vehicles safely bring troops to where they need to be, when they need to be there. While our role in these missions is moderate, we are humbled to be part of this incredibly worthwhile undertaking. <strong>\u201c<em>For over six decades, American peacekeepers have helped protect human rights, advance democracy and the rule of law, and offer aid to those most in need. They have helped people and societies recover after the violence of war, and made sure the voices of the most vulnerable are represented and heard in peace processes.\u201d\u00a0 <\/em><\/strong>The Rt. Honourable Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of USA on National Peacekeepers Day, April 9, 2018. Whether we at INKAS are supporting American or other allied Peacekeepers, we are committed to advancing the interests of human rights and humankind on a global scale. Thank you for your vision Prime Minister Trudeau; you have our support. \u00a0<\/p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\r\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-14394 floatLeft\" src=\"https:\/\/inkasarmored.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Inkas-Rita-chairperson02.jpg?_t=1626723536\" alt=\"\" width=\"306\" height=\"306\" srcset=\"https:\/\/inkasarmored.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Inkas-Rita-chairperson02.jpg 400w, https:\/\/inkasarmored.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Inkas-Rita-chairperson02-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/inkasarmored.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/Inkas-Rita-chairperson02-150x150.jpg 150w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 306px) 100vw, 306px\" \/><\/p>\r\n<div class=\"bio\"><strong>Kari Joy Bounma<\/strong><br \/>Chairperson<br \/>INKAS<sup>\u00ae<\/sup> Group of Companies<\/div>\r\n<\/div>\r\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p><strong>\u201c<em>Of all our dreams today, there is none more important \u2014 or so hard to realise \u2014 than that of peace in the world.
