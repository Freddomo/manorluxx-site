That&#8217;s close to 20 collisions, bumps, and scrapes every hour. What can we do to lower that number? Well, it takes more than just quality construction and cutting-edge&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/troyarmoring.com\/four-safety-features-of-armored-vehicles-everyone-loves\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">safety features<\/a>&nbsp;to keep drivers safe. Modern cars are now equipped with various features that protect drivers and passengers, from airbags to seatbelts and automatic braking. And as technology evolves, there are additional upgrades you can add to your car that offer even more protection.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are five essential car accessories for improving safety on the road and how they work to keep everyone better protected.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Upgrades Your Car Needs for Safer Driving<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em>1. Backup Cameras<\/em><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Driving in reverse can be tricky because you have limited visibility. Backup cameras make navigating much easier, making them a must-have safety upgrade. These small cameras are mounted on the back of your car and connected to a monitor inside the vehicle. With this camera, you&#8217;ll get a clear view of what&#8217;s behind you so you can confidently back in and out of tight spots.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all cars come with backup cameras, so you may want to consider getting this upgrade to ensure that you have this vital safety feature.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em>2. Forward Collision Warning Systems<\/em><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Forward collision warning systems are another must-have for safer driving. These systems use sensors in the front of your vehicle to detect when an object is too close, alerting you to avoid a crash.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>These systems are beneficial in busy areas with heavy traffic, as they can detect a potential collision even when it&#8217;s difficult to see other vehicles.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em>3. Blind Spot Monitoring Systems<\/em><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>These systems constantly scan the area around your car, alerting you when a vehicle or other object enters one of your blind spots. This keeps you safer by reducing your risk of getting into an accident.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Blind spot monitoring systems are beneficial when merging, as they let you know when it&#8217;s safe to change lanes and when there could be a potential collision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em>4. Reinforced Bumpers<\/em><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Reinforced bumpers do not prevent collisions, but they can reduce their severity by lowering the impact of a crash. When you&#8217;re involved in a fender-bender, your car absorbs all the force from the collision. If you reinforce your bumpers with shock absorbers or other materials, it can slow down the transfer of force and minimize injuries.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><em>5. Bulletproof Glass<\/em><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for the ultimate car safety upgrade, consider installing&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/troyarmoring.com\/how-thick-should-a-bulletproof-glass-be\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bulletproof glass<\/a>. These windows are a combination of strong and durable materials that can withstand even high-powered bullets. If your car has standard windows, this upgrade could save your life if someone starts shooting at you on the highway or in a parking lot.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Takeaway<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Car safety is a critical issue. Fortunately, you can make various upgrades to your car to improve protection and reduce the risk of collisions. From backup cameras to reinforced bumpers and bulletproof glass, these features help keep you safer on the road. So, if you&#8217;re looking for ways to improve your safety on the road, consider investing in these vital car accessories.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Want to ramp up your safety?&nbsp;<\/em><a href=\"https:\/\/troyarmoring.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Troy Armoring<\/em><\/a><em>&nbsp;offers bulletproof cars equipped with the latest safety features.
