However, it isn’t all about the lavish look. In life-threatening situations, the <a href=\"https:\/\/inkasarmored.com\/armored-vehicles-for-sale\/\">armored vehicle<\/a> will save their life. By merging the ultimate design and performance of the high-end Mercedes-Benz cars and the advanced armoring features, the result is a luxury vehicle that guarantees a safe ride.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #0e101a; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Throughout history, a Mercedes-Benz wasn’t seen only as a status symbol. Its armoring features protected artists, politicians, and business people from attacks. The industry has evolved today, offering innovative features that provide ultimate protection. Thanks to the modern features, an armored luxury Mercedes-Benz vehicle can withstand rifle fire and the explosion of up to two hand grenades simultaneously.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>The first armored Mercedes-Benz car<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #0e101a; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Mercedes-Benz launched the first armored car in the world back in 1928. The luxury vehicle featured superior performance that stood out for that time. The N\u00fcrburg 460 could serve a distance of 20,000 kilometers within 13 days, which was considered a pretty impressive capability in the past.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #0e101a; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The Japanese Emperor Hirohito was the proud owner of this vehicle. Although it was noted as the first armored car in the world, the armoring features of N\u00fcrburg weren’t documented.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #0e101a; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The armored N\u00fcrburg became the first PopeMobil in 1930. Today it is located in the Vatican, being on the list of the top 10 expensive cars in the world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #0e101a; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The first documented information about the armoring features refers to the Pullman series. The luxury armored limousines were created in 1931, offering utmost comfort and safety for VIPs. The sliding steel panels shield the windows and windscreen and can be deployed from the inside. After the Pullman series, Mercedes-Benz made a 70-year break in armored vehicle production. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>The most expensive publicly-announced armored Mercedes-Benz that was ever made<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #0e101a; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">In 2018, INKAS<span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial; color: #2d2d2d; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">\u00ae<\/span> Armored Vehicle Manufacturing announced a special commission <a href=\"https:\/\/inkasarmored.com\/mercedes-benz\/\">Armored Mercedes-Benz<\/a> <a href=\"https:\/\/inkasarmored.com\/armored-suv-based-on-mercedes-g63-amg\/\">G63 AMG<\/a> Limousine as the most expensive armored Mercedes-Benz ever made to be publicly announced at the time. With a staggering price of $1.2 million, this vehicle included sophisticated armoring features that offered utmost protection, as well as a stretched cabin and countless luxurious appointments.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #0e101a; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">There are only a few companies that specialize in ultra-VIP armored luxury vehicles in the world.

Even though the vehicle is equipped with advanced armoring features, it still feels relatively OEM when driven. The experts at INKAS<span style=\"font-size: 8pt; font-family: Arial; color: #2d2d2d; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">\u00ae<\/span> Armored managed to merge high security, durability, performance, and aesthetics while providing a comfortable ride for up to four passengers in a private office-like environment.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><strong>Celebrities who drove an armored Mercedes-Benz<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #0e101a; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">A large segment within the armoring industry belongs to celebrities and UVIPs alike, who often need additional protection while being transported publicly. These vehicles are required to both deliver in terms of luxury and style, as well as bulletproof protection for all occupants. Even though many celebrities have an impressive car collection, in many cases they own at least one armored vehicle that guarantees a safe ride.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #0e101a; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Many royalty, politicians, musicians, actors, and business owners rely on their armored Mercedes-Benz to remain safe during their everyday commute.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #0e101a; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">For example, Elvis Presley was one of the proud owners of a 1969 Mercedes-Benz 600 Pullman limousine. Also referred to as the Grand Mercedes, it was the most luxurious car worldwide at the time, with Rolls-Royce as its only competitor. The special additions to this vehicle lineup included a convertible version, jump-seat limousines, and a special edition coupe. Other famous people that owned a Pullman limousine were Fidel Kastro, Elizabeth Taylor, John Lennon, and George Harrison.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 11pt; font-family: Arial; color: #0e101a; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The trend of having armored Mercedes-Benz vehicles remains among celebrities today.
