These are loaded with all of the features and have luxury finishes. While this is certainly an option, it is not the only way to get an armored car. If you don\u2019t need the features or prestige of a luxury brand, you can easily get an armored car that starts as a non-luxury vehicle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-c2b1c5c2 gb-headline-text\"><strong>Nearly Auto Can Be Modified<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The thing to remember is that an armored car is simply a regular car that features various modifications to protect its occupants. Most of those modifications can be done to a non-luxury auto just as easily as they would be applied to a luxury vehicle.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Some Examples of Non-Luxury Armored Cars<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, Troy Armoring offers armored sedans and SUVs both from luxury and non-luxury brands. You will have more options if you want a luxury auto. However, you can still consider getting an armored <a href=\"https:\/\/troyarmoring.com\/car\/toyota-camry\/\">Toyota Camry<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/troyarmoring.com\/car\/toyota-camry-xle-v6\/\">Camry XLE V6<\/a>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some non-luxury armored SUV and truck options include the <a href=\"https:\/\/troyarmoring.com\/car\/ford-350\/\">Ford F-350<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/troyarmoring.com\/car\/jeep-grand-cherokee\/\">Jeep Grand Cherokee<\/a>. Or you can get something like the <a href=\"https:\/\/troyarmoring.com\/car\/gmc-yukon\/\">GMC Yukon<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/troyarmoring.com\/car\/chevrolet-suburban\/\">Chevrolet Suburban<\/a>, which are not from a luxury brand but are commonly considered in the same category as luxury autos at the highest trim levels.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why would you want to skip the luxury brand? For some people, it\u2019s a price issue. Others simply believe that non-luxury autos are less conspicuous, reducing the risk of potential attacks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>You Will Have Even More Luxury Options<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While you can get armored cars that started out as non-luxury SUVs, many people prefer to choose luxury brands. From the Rolls Royce Phantom to the Mercedes Benz S580 to the Jaguar XJL, you can choose from plenty of <a href=\"https:\/\/troyarmoring.com\/sedans\/\">luxury armored sedans<\/a>. The selection of luxury SUV armored autos is equally impressive, such as the Lexus LX 570, BMW X5, Mercedes-Benz Brabus, and Range Rover Defender.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want even more luxury than those, Troy Armoring also offers VIP vans and executive packages on SUVs and stretch limos.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>You Decide What\u2019s Right for You<\/strong><\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The bottom line is that you get to decide what is right for you when it comes to armored cars. If you only feel comfortable in an auto with high-end finishes and a luxury name, you will be able to find it. If you don\u2019t want to draw attention with a luxury or high-end vehicle or you just don\u2019t see the point in spending the extra money on the brand, then you can get an armored auto from a non-luxury brand. Each option has its pros and cons.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-d54f2810 gb-headline-text\"><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>You will typically find a better selection of armored vehicles from luxury sedans and SUVs, but you can easily find ones that began as non-luxury vehicles. These still offer the same high level of protection and can be a bit more inconspicuous. However, you miss out on the prestige of the name and potentially on some features. You will have to decide which option is right for you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When most people think of an armored car, they imagine the high-end versions.
