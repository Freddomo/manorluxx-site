With extensive experience supplying vehicles to law enforcement agencies, governments, corporations, and high net-worth individuals globally \u2013 INKAS\u00ae team of engineers has streamlined manufacturing down to a science.<\/p>\n<p>With its state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities, INKAS\u00ae has the fastest turnaround times in its industry. The full armoring process of a vehicle can typically be completed in less than a month, while the timeframe can vary for more complex requirements with additional features and technologies.<\/p>\n<p>Every vehicle manufactured at INKAS\u00ae goes through three main stages: preparation, armoring, and finalization \u2013 with thorough inspections at each step to ensure strict quality control.<\/p>\n<p>During the initial preparation stage of an armored vehicle, the engineering team uses a 3D modelling system to design the components required for the armoring of the specific vehicle model. While the required parts are being processed, the team of technicians completely strips the vehicle down to its bare frame, inspects the OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) parts, and systematically organizes the individual parts in preparation for the armoring phase.<\/p>\n<p>The second step is the armoring stage where the laser-cut ballistic steel is clad within the frame of the soon-to-be armored vehicle. In order to offer 360 protection, the vehicle\u2019s floor and roof are armored as well. The vehicle\u2019s wheels are fitted with run-flat devices that enable the vehicle to travel at full speed up to an hour even with completely punctured tires. INKAS\u00ae goes as far as armoring key components both beneath the hood and under the vehicle \u2013 such as the gas tank, Engine Control Unit (ECU) and battery. In order to ensure that the vehicle is able to carry the additional weight of the ballistic armor and bulletproof glass, INKAS\u00ae meticulously reinforces each vehicle\u2019s critical components such as its suspension and braking system. Furthermore, INKAS\u00ae proprietary overlap system is implemented in the vehicle\u2019s door seams to protect passengers from potential bullets coming through the door seals.<\/p>\n<p>Once the armoring process is completed, the vehicle\u2019s interior is reassembled and refitted into the now-armored vehicle. To ensure the armoring is discreet, INKAS\u00ae\u00a0pays close attention to detail to ensure that the finished vehicle almost identically matches the original version, both inside and outside. During this stage, all additional requested protective technologies are installed \u2013 such as smokescreen devices, sirens, spotlights, dual door locking systems, and other security features. Finally, the vehicle undergoes a full round of quality control and road testing by technicians, and then proceeds to be cleaned and polished in preparation for shipment.<\/p>\n<p>INKAS\u00ae has extensive experience in armoring a wide array of vehicle types and models, and is renowned worldwide for its high quality products and customer service.
