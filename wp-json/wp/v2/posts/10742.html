What began as something only found in sci-fi movies has quickly become a fast-growing trend in the worlds of social media, video games, healthcare, and even interior design. With AR, INKAS\u00ae offers anyone the ability to review new products online in a 3D, 360\u00b0 environment\u2014whenever and wherever they want. Moreover, the vehicle\u2019s interior can be viewed from the inside by simply stepping into the vehicle. Not only does this give interested parties the flexibility to shop around at their convenience, but they can also envision the vehicles in the real world in real time.<\/p>\n<p>One of the exciting features of the new INKAS\u00ae app is the ability to modify the vehicle\u2019s finishing with spray paint to make a custom design. This adds some fun to the \u201cwindow shopping\u201d experience, and it also allows users to see how color changes the look and feel of the vehicle. Moreover, the user can choose to explore the vehicle\u2019s protective features which get highlighted when the\u00a0<em>Features<\/em>\u00a0mode is activated, providing users with both visual cues and descriptions of features such as \u201creinforced ballistic glass\u201d, \u201cblast protection\u201d and others.<\/p>\n<p>AR is popular today because it allows anyone to change and manipulate their own reality. It alters a user\u2019s environment and gives them an immersive experience that a simple webpage can\u2019t provide. Bringing this technology to the armored vehicle world is an exciting way to give viewers more control over their buying experience and allow them to customize and even snap and send designs to others.<\/p>\n<p>Comparing and shopping around for any type of vehicle can be time-consuming, but with the new\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/inkasarmored.com\/app\/\">INKAS\u00ae AR app\u00a0<\/a>built in partnership with\u00a0Augmently Inc.,\u00a0anyone can view some of the best armored vehicles on the market from the comfort of their own homes or offices.
