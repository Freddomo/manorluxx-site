There are a number of enhanced features in the 2019 Mercedes Benz G-Wagon that are worth noting. The interior of the new model has undergone significant engineering and styling modifications. Even its exterior has been changed despite the iconic design of the G-Wagon.<\/p>\n<p>For the last four decades, the classic look of the Mercedes Benz G-Wagon has gone virtually unchanged, carrying the old school feel through to its newest models. However, the 2019 G63 model has rounded door frames, circular LED accents on the headlights, and has had an AMG Panamerica grille added. In terms of dimensions, the 2019 Mercedes Benz G-Wagon has changed drastically. It is 2.1 inches longer, 2 inches wider, and its wheelbase has spread by 1.6 inches. To maintain a high degree of maneuverability and off-road capabilities, the new G63 has been made out of lightweight metal \u2013 reducing its mass by an impressive 375 pounds compared to its predecessor.<\/p>\n<p>The significant change in dimensions has led to improvements to the G-Wagon\u2019s interior layout, which now provides spacious and comfortable room for both driver and passengers. The passenger rear seats get an extra six inches of legroom, while the front seat has two inches of legroom added. The 2019 Mercedes Benz has a completely new and modern feel on the inside, featuring the latest switch gears and controls found in the\u00a0S-\u00a0and\u00a0E-Class models. The quality of materials is now amongst Mercedes Benz\u2019s finest, with a wide selection of first-rate and exclusive materials. The G63 is equipped with dual 12.3-inch displays that integrate seamlessly into the dashboard \u2013 one serves as the instrument cluster and the other as an interactive media system with voice command interactions.\u00a0The vehicle also features Android and Apple connectivity, an adaptive 64-color LED lighting system, a new and improved sound system as well as cooled and heated front and rear seats.<\/p>\n<p>The 2019 G-Wagon comes with the advanced AMG Performance 4MATIC all-wheel drivetrain that features a front\/rear torque distribution ratio of 40:60 which dramatically improves on-road handling. The pleasant driving experience is supported by an AMG 4.0-liter V8 twin-turbo engine enhanced by a nine-speed automatic transmission with a torque converter that enables the motor to produce up to 577 horsepower\u00a0and 627 lb-ft of torque. Some of the newest safety features previously unavailable in the 2018 G-Wagon include a forward-collision warning, automatic emergency braking, full-speed adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist and a driver inattention warning system.<\/p>\n<p>The brand-new features and upgrades to the 2019 Mercedes Benz G-Wagon make for a driving experience that is much more enjoyable, convenient, and safe. While there is a long waitlist to purchase the new Mercedes Benz G63, INKAS\u00ae has secured a limited supply of the cult-vehicle and has become one of the first companies in the industry to armor the G-Wagon. The armored G63 is manufactured to meet an uncompromised level of protection that meets CEN 1063 BR6 ballistic standards, providing 360-degree protection from high-power rifle ammunition as well as the simultaneous detonation of two hand grenades below the vehicle\u2019s floor.
